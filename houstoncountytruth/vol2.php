  <h3><b>The Criminal Enterprise known as SPLOST and made possible
  by ELECTION FRAUD continues in Houston County, Georgia as the
  local school board will try to pass another sales tax increase in
  a referendum on 6 November 2001. Read on for more about the media
  and law enforcement cover up of this Election Fraud.</b></h3>

  <div align="justify">
    <p>This Volume II edition of THE HOUSTON COUNTY TRUTH will deal
    with more specifics of the ELECTION FRAUD committed by our
    elected officials in Houston County, Georgia in 1996 and the
    reasons the fraud has not been widely reported. We will also
    see why the fraud perpetrators have not been brought to
    justice. The Election Fraud has not been widely reported
    because the newspapers owned by the Knight Ridder conglomerate
    in Middle Georgia have covered it up and refused to investigate
    it. This includes the Macon Telegraph, Warner Robins Daily Sun,
    Warner Robins Buyers' Guide, and The Byron Gazette. Remember
    that the people at the Warner Robins Buyers' Guide print the
    Byron Gazette and remove anything they don't like. So even if
    someone at the Byron Gazette wanted to publish the truth about
    the Election Fraud, it would not get past the censors at the
    Warner Robins Buyers' Guide.</p>

    <p>The Election Fraud scheme is explained fully in the Volume I
    edition of the Houston County Truth published in October, 2000.
    At the end of October, 2000, I delivered over 10,000 copies of
    The Houston County Truth, Volume I, to the Warner Robins
    Buyers' Guide to be delivered as a <b>PAID</b> flier to the
    people of Houston County. My newsletter was accepted on Friday
    by the lady who handles such things. On Monday, when publisher
    Mike Hall and editor David Cranshaw saw what I had written
    about the Knight Ridder cover up, they refused to accept the
    newsletter for delivery. Later, the Macon Telegraph and the
    Warner Robins Daily Sun also refused <b>PAID</b> delivery for
    my newsletter. They were not going to let the news about their
    role in the cover up get out if they could help it. Publisher
    Jeannie Enyart refused for the Macon Telegraph and General
    Manager John Hall refused for the Daily Sun. Thousands of
    copies were distributed to the people anyway.</p>

    <p>All of this information and much more is available on my web
    site: http://www.houstoncountytruth.org</p>

    <p>Here is the definition of <b>FRAUD:</b> The concealment of
    what should have been disclosed that deceives or is intended to
    deceive another so that he shall act upon it to his legal
    injury-- also called <b>"Actual Fraud".</b></p>

    <p>Here is the 1996 ELECTION FRAUD scheme. In the General
    election in November, 1996, a proposed amendment to the Georgia
    Constitution to allow county school districts to hold sales tax
    referendums to benefit county schools was on the ballot. The
    amendment passed. However, voters in Houston County did not
    know that a confusing and hard to understand paragraph had been
    SECRETLY added to the end of the Education Amendment by our
    dishonorable Houston County State Legislators in January, 1996.
    The SECRET paragraph was intended was intended to hurt the
    people of Houston county and possibly Richmond county because
    these were the only two counties in the state with a tax
    cap.</p>

    <p>This SECRET paragraph removed our tax cap requirement that
    said that any sales tax increase in Houston county had to be
    offset by a decrease in ad valorum (property) taxes. Houston
    county voters were tricked into voting for something harmful to
    them without any chance to fight it since they didn't know that
    their "trusted' elected officials had betrayed them. This is
    why our property taxes don't have to be decreased every time a
    SPLOST is passed. We must defeat SPLOST every time it is put on
    the ballot or it is a victory for the felons that committed
    this ELECTION FRAUD and the media who covered it up and the law
    enforcement people who won't investigate including the Houston
    County District Attorney, Kelly Burke.</p>

    <p>Houston County officials who actively participated or had to
    know about about the ELECTION FRAUD scheme and kept it a secret
    from the people were: "Judge" Buster McConnell, State Senator
    Sonny Perdue, Houston County State Representatives: Larry
    Walker, Sonny Watson, Johnny Floyd and Robert Ray. County
    School Board Members: Tina Fletcher, Gary McClure, Hubert
    Hutchinson, Fred Wilson, Skip Talbert, Shirley Lowery, and Dave
    Davidson. Also, County School Superintendent Tony Hinnant and
    County School Board Attorney Billy Jerles had to know. Houston
    County Commissioners: Larry Snellgrove, Jay Walker, Jim Carter,
    Calvin Mayes, and the late Sherrill Stafford who admitted to me
    in June 1998 that they carried out their secret ELECTION FRAUD
    scheme because they knew the people would never vote against
    their tax cap if they knew about it. He named the person that
    thought up this scheme and that person told me it was somebody
    else. These people will climb over each other to cop a plea if
    we could break their ring of media and law enforcement
    protection and get them on trial in a court of law. County
    Attorney Mike Long also had to know.</p>

    <p>David Cranshaw, editor of the Warner Robins Buyers' Guide,
    promised off and on in the first part of year 2000 that he
    would publish the investigative report I had sent to the
    Georgia Attorney General in June, 1998. In July, 2000 , he said
    that it looked like I was right about the ELECTION FRAUD and
    the people had a right to know about it and make up their own
    minds and he promised to do the article as an interview at the
    end of July. I really thought that he was going to quit
    protecting his crony, " Buster', and the rest of the boys but
    he just couldn't do it. His reluctance all the time was based
    on not being able to write the truth about Buster McConnell and
    the rest. We did the interview but he wouldn't publish it so I
    wrote Volume I of the Houston County Truth in October, 2000.
    Volume I is on my web site.</p>

    <p>One other problem is Houston County District Attorney Kelly
    Burke. He absolutely refuses to do an investigation into this
    ELECTION FRAUD. He sounds like the defense attorney for these
    people. He always has an excuse of some kind. If he is not
    doing his job because these people are his cronies, he should
    say he has a conflict of interest and call in another district
    attorney. He needs to look for reasons to do his job instead of
    the other way around. Maybe it is time for Mr. Burke to
    resign.</p>

    <p>Judge Ed Lukemire was D.A. in January, 1996, when the SECRET
    paragraph was offically added to the Education amendment in the
    Georgia Legislature by our dishonorable legislators. I don't
    know if he knew the Election Fraud was going on. He later was
    elected to the judgeship that "Judge" Buster resigned from
    three weeks after Buster did his part in the Election Fraud
    scheme.</p>

    <p>Terrorists from across the sea are trying to destroy our
    election process and our system of government from outside our
    country and the ELECTION FRAUD people and our irresponsible
    media and law enforcement people are trying to destroy us from
    within. We really have to get up off our butts and stop them.
    Vote: <b>NO SPLOST</b> every time!!!!! <b>FIGHT
    CRIME!!!</b></p>
