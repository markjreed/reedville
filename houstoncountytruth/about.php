  <h1 class="headline">Political Corruption in Houston County, Georgia</h1>

  <div align="justify">
    <p>Houston County is the most politically corrupt county in
    Georgia. The corruption ranges throughout our county
    government. The particular act of corruption and criminal
    activity under discussion is an instance of <a href=
    "letters">election fraud</a> committed by some Houston
    County officials in the 1996 General Election. The following
    people were involved: a superior court judge, a state senator,
    four state representatives, five county commissioners, some
    school board members and at least two attorneys.</p>

    <p>The <b>election fraud</b> in 1996 brought financial harm to
    the citizens of Houston County because it removed a very
    important part part of our tax cap law that was in force since
    1982. This was the start of the Special Local Option sales tax
    law(SPLOST). The consequence of the election fraud treachery
    was the removal of a provision in our tax cap law that said
    that any sales tax increase in Houston County had to be offset
    by a decrease in ad valorem taxes. Because of the election
    fraud committed by our local officials, our ad valorem taxes no
    longer had to be reduced if the citizens passed a sales tax
    such as a Special Local Option Sales Tax (SPLOST).</p>

    <p>The citizens have been conned twice into passing SPLOST
    referendums and their local sales taxes in Houston County have
    gone up from one percent to three percent. The ad valorem taxes
    have not gone down any because of the election fraud. The
    School Board gets two percent and the County Commissioners get
    one percent. The School Board has been getting a one percent
    sales tax since the tax cap law was passed in 1982.</p>

    <p>We can lower our sales taxes by defeating every SPLOST
    extension that is put on the ballot from now on. The time for
    the two SPLOSTS that have been passed is running out. FIGHT
    CRIME- Vote NO on every SPLOST in the future. We don't have to
    suffer the <a href=
    "/consequence.php">consequences</a> of the
    election fraud. We must fight on by voting "NO SPLOST". Justice
    will prevail someday.</p>

    <p>I sent a <a href=
    "/investigation.php">report</a> to the Georgia
    Attorney General and the Georgia Secretary of State in June,
    1998, and July, 1998, respectively, about this election fraud,
    and asked them to investigate this matter.</p>

    <p>The Middle Georgia newspapers have added to the local
    corruption by refusing to publish anything about this election
    fraud matter. That is why I started a <a href=
    "/latest.php">newsletter</a> called the <i>Houston County
    Truth</i>.</p>

    <p>I had eleven thousand copies of the <i>Houston County
    Truth</i> printed for distribution to the citizens of Houston
    county. I planned to pay for the distribution as a flyer by the
    <i>Warner Robins Buyers Guide</i>, <i>Daily Sun</i>, or the
    <i>Macon Telegraph</i>. All newspapers refused to distribute my
    newsletter; they don't accept criticism very well. Check out
    their official <a href="distribution.php">reasons</a> on the 
    <a href="letters/">Letters</a> page.
