Kelly Burke<BR>
District Attorney, Houston County<BR>
North 201 Perry Parkway<BR>
Perry, Ga. 31069<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Sir:<BR>
<BR>
I am writing seeking your assistance in determining whether violations of existing statutes has occurred as committed by the Houston County Board of Commissioners.<BR>
<BR>
There are two points which I wish to bring to your attention.  First, I believe a violation of the Comprehensive Land Development Regulation for Houston County may have occurred on August 19<SUP>th</SUP>.  For your reference, I refer to sections 116.5, 116.7, and 161.<BR>
<BR>
On August 5<SUP>th</SUP> during its regularly scheduled meeting, the Board of Commissioners considered two re-zoning petitions requested by Mr. Charles McGlamry and Mr. Howard Wooden.  The petition is known as Rezoning Application #1282.  One of the petitions was granted.  The second, a request to rezone 32.21 acres from R-1 to R-3 was denied by the lack of a second to the motion to approve made by Commissioner McMichael.<BR>
<BR>
Following that meeting, the Commission Chairman decided that the lack of a second to the motion did not adequately address the petition and he re-scheduled another vote on the issue for the meeting held August 19<SUP>th</SUP>.  In his remarks prior to placing the matter before the Board for consideration, the Chairman stated that the Land Development Regulation required an &#147;up or down&#148; vote on the matter.  <BR>
<BR>
There are several points that contradict his explanation.  First, section 116.5 of subject regulation states in part  &#147;The Governing Body shall hold a public hearing at the earliest possible time under the time limits spelled out above to consider the proposed zoning amendment, and shall <B>take action on said proposed zoning amendment within 45 days from the date of the public hearing&#133;.&#148;.</B>  With all respect to the Chairman, I contend that action on the proposed zoning amendment was taken by the Board when the motion to approve was made and died for the lack of a second to the motion.  Next, the Chairman&#146;s actions provide a method to circumvent section 116.7, which requires a six month delay prior to re-submitting a zoning amendment on the same property.  I believe that the Chairman&#146;s actions negate equal and due process opportunities to all residents of Houston County.<BR>
<BR>
Additionally, at the August 19<SUP>th</SUP> meeting called to address the original question, the original motion was never addressed.  Instead, a motion to send the application back to the Planning and Zoning Board was made and passed.  This constitutes new action on the rezoning request somewhat the same as if the original petitioner had made a second request for review of the application.  The actions of the Chairman and the Board certainly conflict with the spirit and intent of section 116.5 and 116.7.<BR>
<BR>
Sir, my question for your review is, &#147;Have the actions of the Commission violated the Land Development Regulation such that a violation of Section 69-9905 of the Georgia Code Annotated may have occurred?&#148;<BR>
<BR>
The second question I wish to bring to your attention is whether the Board of Commissioners has violated the Georgia Open Meetings law.<BR>
<BR>
Commissioner Tom McMichael is quoted on page 1B of the August 20<SUP>th</SUP> issue of the <I>Macon Telegraph</I>, &#147;I have talked considerably over the past week with the other commissioners and the consensus was it would not be approved as an R-3&#148;.  His quoted statement indicates that Board members met in some method and in some number to discuss an issue that was addressed as official business at the August 5<SUP>th</SUP> meeting and which was known to be referred to the Board by Chairman at the August 19<SUP>th</SUP> meeting.  At the very least, a polling of members of the Board has occurred in secretive session(s).  This violates the citizens' right to witness the conduct of business on matters affecting their lives.<BR>
<BR>
It should also be noted, that even before the meeting convened, the Commission&#146;s decision to return the petition to the Planning and Zoning Board was known by the press and reported to citizens in attendance of the meeting.  Clearly, business has been conducted in secret session.<BR>
<BR>
Sir, my question to you on this matter is, &#147;Has the Commission violated the state&#146;s Open Meeting laws?&#148;<BR>
<BR>
If you find that violation of law has occurred in either or both situations I have referred to you, I ask that you take such appropriate actions as are necessary to ensure that further violations of these types do not occur again.<BR>
<BR>
Let me say that I have no ill feeling toward any Commission member and certainly none against the re-zoning petitioners.  My sole objective is to secure equal opportunity and treatment for all Houston County residents and to ensure that the Commission conducts all its functions in a lawful manner.<BR>
