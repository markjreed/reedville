  <div align="justify">
    Sonny Perdue, Governor of Georgia, has conned the voters of
    Georgia and particularly the voters of Houston county one more
    time. Every person who thought they were voting for a man who
    would be loyal to the people and had their best interests at
    heart and truly wanted the people to participate in their
    government have been conned big time. The real Sonny
    Perdue&rsquo;s loyalty has always been given first,last, and
    only to his political party so that they could maintain control
    over the people they were supposed to represent. Perdue was a
    loyal storm trooper for the Democrats for many years and was
    one of their leaders who made sure that the people never got to
    vote on a proposed constitutional amendment that would have
    given the people the right to <b>Voter Initative</b> <b>and
    Referendum</b> if it passed.<br />
    <br />
    <b>Voter Initiative</b> is the process of citizens proposing
    laws or constitutional amendments, by petition, for a statewide
    vote. <b>Voter Referendum</b> is a similar process which allows
    voters to change or repeal legislation passed by the General
    Assembly. We want it and we need it because true political
    reform and the much needed citizen participation in our
    government will not be possible without it. Twenty eight states
    have <b>Voter Initiative and/or Voter Referendum</b> now. Polls
    have shown that the people overwhelmingly support Voter
    Initiative legislation. If that is true, why don&rsquo;t
    Georgians have <b>Voter Initiative?<br />
    <br /></b> Here is the answer. For <b>Voter Initiative</b> to
    become law, it must first be put on the ballot as a proposed
    Constitutional Amendment and the citizens must pass it by a
    majority vote. However, before it can be put on the ballot for
    people to vote on, a <b>Voter Initiative</b> <b>Resolution</b>
    must pass the Georgia House and Senate by a two-thirds majority
    vote. There is the problem. Over the past few years, many
    <b>Voter Initiative Resolutions</b> have been bottled up in
    committees in the House and Senate that were controlled by the
    Democrats. This made sure that the people of Georgia would
    never have the right to <b>Voter</b> <b>Initiative,</b> State
    Senator Sonny Perdue and Houston County Representatives Larry
    Walker and Sonny Watson and others helped make sure that the
    people of Houston County and the state of Georgia would never
    have the right to participate in our state government.<br />
    <br />
    Sonny Perdue campaigned on the idea that he wanted to make it
    possible for the people to be&rdquo; more involved &ldquo; in
    their government. That was an out and out deliberate
    <b><font size="4">LIE</font></b> from the beginning. All of
    these people were dedicated to making sure that they always had
    their feet on the necks of the people they were supposed to
    represent. They consider themselves your masters, not your
    representatives. As long as we elect people of this kind, we
    will never have a government we can trust and respect. Roy
    &ldquo;The Rat&rdquo; Barnes is one of this kind. In a later
    edition of The Houston County Truth, we will discuss how Sonny
    and Roy worked together to stick it to the people of Georgia by
    scheming to invade the privacy of the people by passing a law
    to require the people to give their fingerprints when they
    apply for a driver&rsquo;s license. Can anyone see a national
    ID card coming? Stay tuned for the actions of the &ldquo;bottom
    feeders&rdquo; in the fingerprint scam. If the voters of
    Georgia had been given the chance to vote on acquiring the
    right of <b>Voter Initiative</b> <b>and Referendum</b> in 1996,
    I am convinced that we would have the right to Voter Initiative
    today. If we had <b>Voter initiative and Referendum,</b> the
    citizens could write <b>laws</b> to be put on the ballot for a
    vote by circulating a petition and getting the required amount
    of signatures of registered voters. The laws would have to be
    constitutional and would be submitted to the legislative
    research and drafting offices of the general assembly for
    review and comment.<br />
    <br />
    A <b>Referendum</b> could be put on the ballot pertaining to
    any act or item, section or part of any act of the general
    assembly by a petition signed by the required amount of voters.
    A binding referendum could be held to settle the flag dispute
    by a vote of the people. A referendum could also be held to
    remove the insulting requirement for people to give their
    fingerprints to get a driver&rsquo;s license. These are just
    two examples of what the people could get to vote on if we had
    <b>Voter Initiative and Referendum</b>. I know that Perdue was
    determined that the people would never have any say in our
    government.<br />
    <br />
    Can we expect our most recently elected Houston County
    legislators to conduct themselves with honor and integrity or
    will they jump right in the pool of corruption and dishonesty
    that awaited them in the General Assembly and be overcome by
    the stench? Will they start to lie and make excuses for their
    lies when they are caught? Will they work to open up our
    government so that it will be easier for citizens to have
    access to public records? It doesn&rsquo;t look good for the
    citizens.<br />
    <br />
    Houston County Representative Larry O&rsquo;neal has already
    broken his pledge that he would not support a tax increase. He
    didn&rsquo;t last long. He said that he didn&rsquo;t make the
    pledge until after the election. I don&rsquo;t know what that
    has to do with breaking your word. Larry is Sonny&rsquo;s floor
    leader in the House. That means you do what Sonny tells you
    instead of having integrity and honoring your word and working
    for the people. Larry is also a lawyer so he thinks he has a
    right to lie. Now you understand what has happened. Larry has
    gone skinny dipping in the pool of corruption in the General
    Assembly.<br />
    <br />
    Newly elected State Senator Ross Tolleson has gone with Larry.
    Tolleson is a Republican from Perry and represents the 18th
    District. Tolleson says that he and Senator Brian Kemp of
    Athens have authored a bill that deals with homeland security.
    What Tolleson doesn&rsquo;t tell you is that the real purpose
    of the bill is to deny citizens access to public documents that
    they have a right to see. He tries to coverup his deceit by
    saying that he is trying to do something for the security of
    our country. That is insulting to our military people stationed
    around the world and fighting in Iraq. They are the ones
    defending us while Tolleson and his ilk are scheming to remove
    some rights from them while they are gone. These people are
    really &ldquo;bottom feeders&rdquo;. We can&rsquo;t let them
    get away with it. This bill number is Senate Bill 113. Yes, I
    have read it. I got it off the internet at the Georgia
    Legislature web site: http://www.legis.state.ga.us/. Click on
    &ldquo;Legislation&rdquo; under 2003-2004 Legislative Session.
    Will Sonny sign Senate Bill 113 into law if it passes?
    Probably.<br />
