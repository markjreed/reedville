    <p>Here come the con men and their lady friends again in
    Houston County, Georgia. On 19 June, 2001, the Mobs of
    "trusted" elected officials from Houston County, and the cities
    of Warner Robins, Perry, and Centerville are holding a
    referendum to continue the eternal (forever) sales tax known as
    Special Local Option Sales Tax (SPLOST). These Mobs want to
    continue a one cent sales tax they get now for another five
    years and eighty five million dollars. The Mob from the Board
    of Education will be along in September to get another one cent
    sales tax going for them for unknown millions. I wouldn't trust
    any of these people with a nickel.</p>

    <p>The authority for Houston County officials to call a
    referendum came from a criminal act known as <b>election
    fraud</b> committed by Houston County officials in 1996. These
    referendums are not only illegal, but immoral as well. I sent a
    <a href="electionfraudinvestigation.php">report</a> to the
    Georgia Attorney General and the Georgia Secretary of State and
    asked them to investigate this matter. Basically, their reply
    was " Not my job, man. Get yourself a lawyer and sue them".
    They protect their cronies. Please read the report to see the
    financial harm that was done to the citizens of Houston County
    by our dishonorable elected officials. The <b>consequence</b>
    of the election fraud treachery was the <b>removal</b> of a
    provision in our tax cap law that stated that any sales tax
    increase in Houston County had to be offset by a decrease in ad
    valorem taxes. Our treacherous elected officials had kept this
    <b>consequence</b> a secret from the citizens of Houston
    County. This constitutes <b>election fraud</b>.</p>

    <p>The Middle Georgia newspapers have added to the local
    corruption by refusing to publish any thing about this election
    fraud matter.That is why I started a <a href=
    "vol2.php">newsletter</a>called the <i>Houston County
    Truth</i>.</p>

    <p>These people who have committed election fraud against the
    citizens of Houston County deserve to be put on trial. These
    people committed a crime against the voters of Houston County
    who have a constitutional right to a fair and honest election.
    We were denied that right by these felons who committed
    election fraud. This crime struck a blow at the very heart of
    our form of government which is our election process.</p>

    <p>The law enforcement agencies that have said "Not my job"
    include the following: the Houston County District Attorney,
    U.S. Attorney, F.B.I., Georgia Attorney General, Georgia
    Secretary of State, and Voting Section,Department of Justice.
    None of these agencies said that these people didn't do this
    election fraud. They just didn't want any thing to do with it.
    It had to be because of corruption, lack of backbone, lack of
    integrity, indifference to their duty, sorriness, laziness, or
    a combination of all the above. These law enforcement agencies
    have to be the largest organized crime groups of them all. And
    the sorriest.</p>

    <p>We can't give up. We can't let the SPLOST criminal
    enterprise win. Justice will prevail some day. We must vote
    <b>NO</b> to all of these SPLOST referendums. At the same time,
    we must work to remove the politically corrupt from our County
    government.</p>

    <p>WE will better serve the children of Houston County if we
    remove the stench of political corruption that hangs over our
    county like a blanket. This should come first before we try to
    con the people into letting someone continue to steal their
    money with an <b>eternal</b> tax. Kids aren't stupid. Why don't
    we ask them if they would rather have a new building built with
    stolen money or an honest and clean County government?</p>

    <p>Please pass this web site address &lt;
    http://www.houstoncountytruth.org &gt; on to everyone you can
    and share this information with people not on the internet. Try
    to get everyone you know to go to the polls and vote <b>NO</b>
    on SPLOST.</p>
