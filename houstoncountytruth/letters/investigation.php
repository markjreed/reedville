  <h2 class="headline">Request for SPLOST Investigation by GA Attorney 
	General</h2>
  <p>19 June1998</p>

  <p>Mr. Thurbert Baker<br />
  Attorney General<br />
  State of Georgia<br />
  40 Capitol Square S.W.<br />
  Atlanta, Georgia 30334-1300</p>

  <p>Sir:</p>

  <p>Re: Request for investigation of collusion, conspiracy, and
  election fraud perpetrated by Houston County elected officials
  against the citizens of Houston County. This pertains to a
  proposed statewide constitutional amendment resolution (HR-728)
  passed by the Georgia General Assembly on 26 January, 1996. This
  constitutional amendment was passed in a referendum in the
  General election in November, 1996. The amendment begins at
  Article VIII, Section VI, Paragraph IV. (Exhibit I)<br />
  <br />
  I am requesting an investigation into the criminal conspiracy by
  our Houston County elected officials who committed
  <b>election</b> fraud by <u>concealing</u> from the citizens of
  Houston County a passage in a proposed 1996 statewide
  constitutional amendment that removed a provision of our Houston
  County Tax Cap Constitutional Amendment that was passed in 1982.
  The provision that was removed stated that &ldquo;any sales tax
  increase in Houston County had to be offset by a decrease in ad
  valorem taxes&rdquo;.[Exhibit II, Page 3, Section 1, Paragraph
  (2)(B)] The 1996 proposed <u>amendment was supposed to be about a
  sales tax to help County schools.</u> The wording on the ballot
  was:<b>&rdquo; Shall the Constitution be amended so as to
  authorize boards of education of county school districts and
  independent school districts to impose, levy, and collect a one
  percent sales and use tax for certain educational purposes
  subject to approval in a local referendum?&rdquo;.</b> <u>There
  was no mention of the tax cap removal language.</u> The
  <u>hidden</u> <u>passage</u> affected <u>only Houston County and
  possibly Richmond County.</u><br />
  <br />
  Our local delegation had the <u>hidden passage</u> added to the
  end of the proposed constitutional amendment in Article VIII,
  Section VI, Paragraph IV, subparagraphs (j)(1) and(j)(2). Of
  course , the <u>hidden passage</u> is written in confusing legal
  jargon to make it difficult to read and interpret. The hidden
  passage does not mention Houston County by name. <u>I found it
  because I was looking for it.</u> I was able to confirm a rumor a
  few months ago in 1998.<br />
  <br />
  The <u>hidden passage</u> says in <u>subparagraph (j)(1)</u>:
  <b>&ldquo;Notwithstanding any provision of any constitutional
  amendment continued in force and effect pursuant to Article XI,
  Section I, Paragraph IV(a) and except as otherwise provided in
  subparagraph (j)(2) of this Paragraph, any <u>political
  subdivision</u> whose ad valorem taxing powers <u>are restricted
  pursuant to such a constitutional amendment</u> may receive the
  proceeds of the tax authorized under this Paragraph or of any
  local sales and use tax authorized by general law, or any
  combination of such taxes, <u>without any corresponding
  limitation</u> of its ad valorem taxing powers which would
  otherwise be required under such constitutional
  amendment.&rdquo;</b> <u>Political subdivision</u> means Houston
  County.<b><br />
  <br /></b> The <u>hidden passage</u> continues in <u>subparagraph
  (j)(2)</u>: <b>&ldquo;The restriction on and limitation of ad
  valorem taxing powers</b> <b>described in subparagraph (j)(1) of
  this Paragraph <u>shall remain applicable</u> with respect to
  proceeds received from the levy of a local sales and use tax
  <u>specifically authorized by a constitutional amendment in</u>
  <u>force and effect pursuant to Article XI,Section I, Paragraph
  IV(a)</u>, as opposed to a local sales and use tax <u>authorized
  by <i>this</i> Paragraph or by general law&rdquo;.<br />
  <br /></u></b> The inclusion of the <u>hidden passage</u> into
  the proposed &ldquo;sales tax for education&rdquo; constitutional
  amendment <u>killed our Tax Cap requirement</u> that any sales
  tax increase had to be <u>offset by a decrease in ad valorem
  taxes.</u>[Exhibit II, Page 3, Section 1, Paragraph (2)(B)] The
  Houston County Board of Education has had a 1% local sales tax
  designated entirely for their use since 1982 as part of the
  Houston County Tax Cap Constitutional Amendment adopted that
  year. Any further sales tax increases were to be offset by
  decreasing ad valorem taxes. A Houston County Board of Education
  sales tax referendum, which was allowed under the 1996
  Constitutional Amendment with the hidden passage, passed on 18
  March, 1997, with no decrease in ad valorem taxes. We are now
  paying a 2% local sales tax for education in Houston County.
  Please read on because it gets worse.<br />
  <u><br /></u> There was no public mention of this <u>hidden
  passage</u> to the Houston County citizens or to the local media.
  I have checked with local citizens that are usually well informed
  and with reporters and editors of local newspapers. None of them
  recall reading it in any newspaper or writing about it. The
  consensus seems to be that they would all consider that <u>hidden
  passage</u> to be very newsworthy. I am sure that some citizens
  would have tried to stop this scheme dead in its tracks if they
  would have known that our elected officials were selling us out.
  There would have been an uproar if the honest citizens had known
  that our &ldquo;trusted&rdquo; elected officials had conspired to
  commit election fraud by deliberately concealing something in the
  legislation that was against the best interests of the citizens
  of Houston County. We were tricked into voting against ourselves.
  Every Houston County citizen is injured by this conspiracy and
  election fraud every time they make a purchase and pay an extra
  1% sales tax. Please read on because the conspiracy, collusion,
  and fraud get worse.<br />
  <br />
  <b>Questions to be answered</b>: (1) Which elected officials were
  involved? (2) Why did they do it?<br />
  <br />
  <b>Answer to question#1</b>-- The people <b>directly</b> involved
  were : Superior Court Judge L. A. &ldquo;Buster&rdquo; McConnell;
  State Senator Sonny Perdue, District 18 ; Houston County State
  Representatives Larry Walker ,District 141; Sonny Watson,
  District 139; Johnny Floyd, District 138; and Robert Ray,
  District 128. Houston County Commissioners Sherrill Stafford,
  Larry Snellgrove, Jay Walker, Jim Carter, and Calvin Mayes, and
  Houston County Attorney Mike Long. I believe that the County
  School Board and Superintendant were <b>indirectly</b> involved
  because they probably knew about the scheme.<br />
  <br />
  <b>Answer to question#2-</b>- Why did they do it? They carried
  out their <u>hidden</u> <u>passage</u> scheme because they knew
  that the Houston County citizens would never vote against that
  provision of the Tax Cap law in an open and honest vote. (See
  Exhibit II, Page 3, Paragraph [2][B] ) Also, another consequence
  of the hidden passage was that the Houston County Comissioners
  could use some of the wording of the hidden passage as
  <b>their</b> authority to call for <b>another sales tax
  referendum</b> to pay for a new jail and courthouse without
  having to decrease ad valorem taxes as called for in the Tax Cap.
  The first step in the scheme was to hide a piece of legislation
  in an unrelated constitutional amendment that would wipe out our
  Tax Cap requirement to decrease the ad valorem tax if the sales
  tax were increased. The first step was accomplished when the
  Georgia Legislature passed the proposed &ldquo;educational&rdquo;
  constitutional amendment with the <u>hidden paragraphs</u> in it
  on 26 January, 1996 and Governor Miller signed it on 15
  April,1996. The first step in the scheme was now complete. All
  the legislators had to do now was make sure that the citizens of
  Houston County did not find out what was hidden in that proposed
  amendment. They managed to keep their secret and the scheme
  continued.<br />
  <br />
  The <u>next step was</u> for the Houston County Commissioners
  <u>to find a way to</u> <u>threaten the citizens with a mill rate
  increase on their ad valorem taxes to pay for the</u> <u>new jail
  and courthouse</u>. The Tax Cap prevented them from raising the
  ad valorem taxes enough to pay for the jail and courthouse under
  normal circumstances. What could they do? <u>The answer was in
  our Tax Cap law</u>. Our Tax Cap law states that &ldquo; <b>Said
  mill rate limitation shall not apply to taxes levied for the
  express purpose of</b> <b>paying the cost of expenditures which
  are in the future</b> <b><u>mandated by court
  order</u></b><u>.</u>.....&rdquo; .(See Exhibit II, Page 4.
  Paragraph [3][D] ) All they needed now was a judge with no
  scruples and nothing to lose to issue a court order to build a
  jail and courthouse and they would have a way to threaten the
  citizens with a mill rate increase. Where would they find a
  &ldquo;judge&rdquo; like <b>that</b>?<br />
  <br />
  This was no problem because Houston County Superior Court
  &ldquo;Judge&rdquo; L.A. &ldquo;Buster&rdquo; McConnell was just
  sitting there waiting to retire. The Commissioners met with
  &ldquo;Judge&rdquo; McConnell and he agreed to do his part. On 14
  June 1996, &ldquo;Judge&rdquo; McConnell gave the Commissioners
  political cover by signing a court order to fund and build a jail
  and courthouse. The &ldquo;Judge&rdquo; retired 3 weeks later and
  is now operating as a Senior &ldquo;Judge&rdquo; making the
  County circuit out of reach of the voters. Is this
  &ldquo;judge&rdquo; a credit or disgrace to the judicial system?
  The County Commissioners could have challenged the court order
  but of course they did not. <u>This court order gave</u> <u>the
  Commissioners the legal power to break the Tax Cap so that they
  could threaten</u> <u>the citizens with an ad valorem tax
  increase if they did not vote to pass a sales tax</u> <u>increase
  in a referendum</u>. This type of threat is known as blackmail.
  After the court order was signed, all our &ldquo;trusted&rdquo;
  elected officials had to do was wait.<br />
  <br />
  The proposed statewide School Board Constitutional Amendment with
  the hidden passage was passed in the General election in
  November, 1996. Our &lsquo;trusted&rsquo; elected officials had
  been successful with their election fraud and deception. The
  citizens did not know that an important part of their Tax Cap law
  had just been erased.<br />
  <br />
  The School Board sales tax referendum allowed by this
  constitutional amendment was held on 18 March,1997. The
  referendum passed. The people still did not know about the hidden
  passage and the 1% sales tax increase was implemented on 1
  July,1997. The Board of Education now had a 2% local sales tax to
  waste.<br />
  <br />
  Now the Commissioners came out of their holes and began to say
  that there was no way out of the court order and that they were
  going to have to build a new jail and courthouse. Over the next
  few months, they put out the word that the people would have huge
  ad valorem increases to pay for twenty years if they did not vote
  yes on another 1% sales tax increase in another referendum on 17
  March, 1998. They scared the hell out of some of our senior
  citizens on a fixed income who were afraid of losing their homes.
  The threats and blackmail worked and another 1% sales tax burden
  was put on the citizens of Houston County. This sales tax becomes
  effective on 1 July, 1998, and then Houston County citizens will
  be paying a 3% local sales tax. This is obscene.<br />
  <br />
  This scheme of collusion, deception, and election fraud is the
  most immoral , disgusting, and unlawful political action taken
  against the people at the county level by their own elected
  officials I have ever witnessed. This may be a new low point even
  for the Georgia Democratic Party. All elected officials were
  Democrats except for one Republican Commissioner and a non
  partisan &ldquo;judge&rdquo;. This is the kind of thing that
  happens when one party and the same people stay in office too
  long. They become arrogant and develop contempt for the people
  they are supposed to serve. They begin to think that the people
  are their servants. The politicians start to see themselves as
  Lords and Masters and are therefore above the law. The
  politicians switch their allegiance and loyalty from their
  constituents to their political parties and the party leaders. We
  can witness this each year from both the Democrats and
  Republicans when the Georgia General Assembly is in session. The
  people of Houston County are now paying the price for this
  arrogance and the allegiance to the political party instead of
  the people.<br />
  <br />
  I expect the Attorney General and his staff and anyone else who
  may become involved in an investigation of this matter to
  remember that their allegiance and loyalty should be to the
  pursuit of truth and justice for the citizens of Houston County.
  I know that the present Attorney General probably knows all of
  these Democratic Legislators involved in this matter. I hope that
  the citizens of Houston County can rely on him to see that a fair
  and thorough investigation is promptly carried out and that he
  will let the chips fall where they may. We shall wait and
  see.<br />
  <br />
  I believe that these elected officials put together an election
  fraud scheme that took over two years to complete from start to
  finish. In January 1996, the local legislators concealed a
  passage in a proposed &ldquo;educational&rdquo; constitutional
  amendment. This hidden passage removed an important provision of
  the Houston County Tax Cap law. On 14 June,1996,
  &ldquo;Judge&rdquo; McConnell issued a court order to build a new
  court house and jail. He retired 3 weeks later. In November,
  1996, the proposed constitutional amendment with the hidden
  passage was passed statewide. On 18 March,1997, the Houston
  County School Board 1% sales tax referendum allowed by the 1996
  constitutional amendment was passed. On 1July 1997, it went into
  effect. On 17 March, 1998, the 1% sales tax referendum for
  building the jail and courthouse was passed under the threat of a
  huge ad valorum tax increase. It will go into effect on 1
  July,1998. That will give Houston County citizens a 3% local
  sales tax.<br />
  <br />
  This scheme took from January, 1996 to July, 1998 to complete.
  Actually, the planning had to start in 1995. This scheme took
  almost 3 years from start to finish. all of these events had to
  happen in this sequence to succeed. It was NOT a
  coincidence.<br />
  <br />
  I need answers to these questions: Is it legal or constitutional
  to change a particular county&rsquo;s constitutional amendment in
  this manner? Is the change valid? What legal recourse do Houston
  County citizens have to completely cancel the entire hidden
  passages sneaked into the unrelated School Sales Tax
  Constitutional amendment?<br />
  <br />
  I want to say, from a personal viewpoint, that this request for
  an investigation was very difficult for me to write. I have known
  a few of these people for sometime. I had a little respect for
  two of them and a lot of respect for one. I don&rsquo;t believe
  they had the same respect for my fellow citizens or me. These
  elected officials lived among us as friends and neighbors. When
  people believe that their friends and neighbors have betrayed
  them, the hurt goes deep and lingers for a long time. I know that
  I shall never forget it.<br />
  <br />
  I don&rsquo;t care what the elected officials&rsquo; motives
  were. All I know is that our open election process is the bedrock
  of the foundation of our Republic. Our election process must
  remain open and honest or our country will fail. People who try
  to manipulate or corrupt our election process offend all decent
  citizens and must be brought before a court for trial after a
  thorough and impartial investigation.<br />
  <br />
  Attorney General Baker, I am requesting that you conduct such an
  investigation. I would appreciate it if you would let me know
  your intentions as soon as possible. If I can be of any
  assistance, please call me. Thank you very much.<br />
  <br />
  Sincerely,<br />
  <br />
