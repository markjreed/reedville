  <h3 class="headline"><b>Elected and Appointed Officials in
  Houston County, Georgia are still</b></h3>

  <h1 class="headline"><b>WANTED</b></h1>

  <h3 class="headline"><b>(For Conspiracy To Commit Election
  Fraud)</b></h3>

  <div align="justify">
    <p>Elected and appointed officials in Houston County, Georgia
    continue to evade the peoples&rsquo; justice because other
    elected law enforcement and judicial officials in Houston
    County and the State of Georgia are violating their oath of
    office. They are refusing to investigate a blatant case of
    conspiracy to commit election fraud against the citizens of
    Houston County.</p>

    <p>Also, the print media in Middle Georgia continues to refuse
    to investigate this election fraud and also refuses to allow
    any public comment about it to be published in their
    newspapers. If you don&rsquo;t believe it, I challenge
    everybody to try to get a complete &ldquo;letter to the
    editor&rdquo; about this election fraud published in any Middle
    Georgia newspaper. In volumes one and two of the <i>Houston
    County Truth,</i> these newspapers were identified as the
    <i>Macon Telegraph, Warner Robins Daily Sun, Byron Gazette,
    Warner Robins Buyers&rsquo; Guide,</i> and the <i>Houston Home
    Journal</i> in Perry. (Volumes One and Two along with my
    election fraud investigation request to the Georgia Attorney
    General and other information are available on my web site at:
    http://www.houstoncountytruth.org</p>

    <p>Since volumes one and two were written, another Houston
    County shoppers newspaper called <i>Buyers&rsquo;
    Connection</i> has been activated to compete with the <i>Warner
    Robins Buyers&rsquo; Guide.</i> The publisher / owner of the
    <i>Buyers&rsquo; Connection</i> is Mike Hall, ex - publisher of
    the <i>Warner Robins Buyers&rsquo; Guide.</i> Mr. Hall was the
    publisher of the <i>Warner Robins Buyers&rsquo; Guide</i> when
    he refused to distribute my Volume One of the <i>Houston County
    Truth</i> as a flyer on a PAID basis in October, 2000.</p>

    <p>I bought a paid ad from <i>The Buyers&rsquo; Connection</i>
    to advertise my web site in January,2002. The ad was supposed
    to have the words &ldquo;political corruption&rdquo; and
    &ldquo;election fraud&rdquo; in it to explain what the web site
    was about. The ad was accepted and I paid for the ad in advance
    to run four times. When the ad appeared the next week, the
    words &ldquo;election fraud&rdquo; were left out. When I
    inquired about this, I discovered that my ad had been censored.
    I let my ad run three more times to see if they would correct
    this and put &ldquo;election fraud&rdquo; back in the ad.They
    did not. When I asked Mike about this, he said that he removed
    &ldquo;election fraud&rdquo; because I had not proven it yet.
    Unbelievable? No, it was just disappointing.</p>

    <p><b>( Late insertion into newsletter) Lets give credit where
    credit is due.</b> After this newsletter was initially drafted
    and put online, the <i>Buyers' Connection</i> published a
    letter from a citizen demanding an investigation into the
    charges of <b>ELECTION FRAUD</b> mentioned in this newsletter.
    They also published a response from Houston County District
    Attorney, Kelly Burke. Of course, Mr. Burke takes the position
    that nothing illegal has been done. I take exception with just
    about every statement he made in his response.</p>

    <p>The response was a great work of <b>fiction</b> and
    <b>fantasy.</b> Would the response be the same if they were
    under oath? Mr. Burke was also responding for the County
    Commissioners and tax officials.They are learning that it is
    dfficult to defend the indefensible. I am willing to let the
    public read the information on my web site and decide for
    themselves who is telling the truth. This is Mr. Burke's first
    public response about this fiasco.</p>

    <p>I hope everyone will try to get a copy of the <i>Buyers"
    Connection</i> and read the letter and response for themselves.
    It is dated August 6 - August 12, 2002. The phone number at the
    <i>Buyers' Connection</i> is 478-329-1005 and it is a free
    newspaper set up in vending machines throughout Houston County.
    I thank the <i>Buyers' Connection</i> for publishing this
    information as a public service. That is what newspapers are
    supposed to be about.</p>

    <p>There is no longer any need for the other newspapers to
    completely cover up this <b>ELECTION FRAUD</b> issue. People
    throughout Houston County know about it now. If the news media
    and law enforcement people had not stonewalled and refused to
    do their jobs, this situation could have been resolved one way
    or the other long ago. I just wanted the Houston County
    citizens to know what happened and to have their case resolved
    in a court of law. Other people have worked to keep that from
    happening.</p>

    <p>A columnist for the <i>Buyers&rsquo; Connection</i> keeps
    writing the praises of our ex-state senator, Sonny Perdue, as
    he continues his campaign for governor. He refuses to
    acknowledge that Perdue was part of the <b>ELECTION FRAUD</b>
    scheme that denied over 31,000 Houston County voters their
    constitutional right to know what they were voting for in the
    general election in 1996. In effect, Sonny Perdue and his
    fellow conspirators denied over 31,000 citizens their
    constitutional right to vote in Houston County. If voters have
    been deceived about the consequences of their votes, they have
    been denied their right to vote.</p>

    <p>Here is the definition of <b>FRAUD:</b> The concealment of
    what should have been disclosed that deceives or is intended to
    deceive another so that he shall act upon it to his legal
    injury-- also called &ldquo;Actual Fraud&rdquo;.</p>

    <p>Here is the 1996 <b>ELECTION FRAUD</b> scheme. In the
    General election in November, 1996, a proposed amendment to the
    Georgia Consitution to allow county school districts to hold
    sales tax referendums to benefit county schools was on the
    ballot. The amendment passed. However, voters in Houston County
    did not know that a confusing and hard to understand paragraph
    had been <b>SECRETLY</b> added to the end of the Education
    Amendment by our dishonorable Houston County State Legislators
    that was intended to hurt <b>only</b> the citizens of Houston
    County because we had a tax cap.</p>

    <p>The <b>SECRET</b> paragraph removed our tax cap requirement
    that said that any sales tax increase in Houston County had to
    be offset by a decrease in ad valorum (property) taxes. Houston
    County voters were tricked into voting for something harmful to
    them without any chance to fight it since they did not know
    that their &ldquo;trusted&rdquo; elected officials had betrayed
    them. That is why our property taxes don&rsquo;t have to be
    decreased every time a SPLOST is passed.</p>

    <p>Houston County officials who actively participated in or had
    to know about the <b>ELECTION FRAUD</b> scheme and deliberately
    concealed this <b>felony</b> were <b>: &ldquo;Judge&rdquo;
    Buster McConnell and State Senator Sonny Perdue;</b> Houston
    County State Representatives: <b>Larry Walker, Sonny Watson,
    Johnny Floyd, and Robert Ray;</b> Houston County School Board
    Members: <b>Tiena Fletcher, Gary McClure, Hubert Hutchinson,
    Fred Wilson, Skip Talbert, Shirley Lowery. and Dave
    Davidson;</b> Houston County Commissioners: <b>Larry
    Snellgrove, Jay Walker, Jim Carter, Calvin Mayes and the late
    Sherill Stafford.</b> Also, Houston County School
    Superintendent <b>Tony Hinnant</b> and County School Board
    Attorney <b>Billy Jerles</b> and County Attorney <b>Mike
    Long</b> had to know about , participate in, and support the
    concealment of, the <b>ELECTION FRAUD</b> scheme.</p>

    <p>The late Sherrill Stafford, Commission Chairman, admitted to
    me in June 1998 that they carried out their <b>secret ELECTION
    FRAUD</b> scheme because they knew that the people would never
    vote against their tax cap if they knew about it. That is why
    they decided to commit the crime of <b>ELECTION FRAUD</b>
    against the citizens of Houston County.</p>

    <p>Why can&rsquo;t these people be brought before a jury of
    their peers and be held accountable for what they have done?
    Houston County District Attorney Kelly Burke has refused to
    even make a preliminary inquiry into this matter. He is more
    interested in protecting his cronies and keeping them from a
    court of law. His betrayal of the trust of the people and
    violating his oath of office is really disgusting. He could ask
    Superior Court Judge Ed Lukemire to request an investigation
    from the Georgia Attorney General since he has a conflict of
    interest. He did that when former school board member Terry
    Hedden forgot where he lived on election day on 6 November,
    2001, and voted illegally in a City election and was charged
    with <b>ELECTION FRAUD</b> . Of course Burke had to do that
    because Hedden&rsquo;s <b>ELECTION FRAUD</b> became publicly
    known so quickly. The Attorney General said that Hedden
    didn&rsquo;t falsify his residence address on purpose so he did
    not commit <b>ELECTION FRAUD.</b> Unbelievable? Not really.
    Politicians protect Politicians. Kelly Burke needs to resign or
    be removed from office.</p>

    <p>Houston County Superior Court Judge Ed Lukemire was the
    Houston County District Attorney when the <b>ELECTION FRAUD</b>
    scheme was planned in 1995 and executed in 1996. He resigned in
    1996 after Buster McConnell resigned as Superior Court
    &ldquo;Judge&rdquo; in July, 1996. He was elected Superior
    Court Judge later that year as a replacement for Buster. In
    January, 2002, I sent a letter to Judge Lukemire which
    contained some information about the <b>ELECTION FRAUD</b>
    scheme and some questions about his possible involvement when
    he was the Houston County District Attorney. Here are two of
    the questions: (1) Did you know that the <b>ELECTION FRAUD</b>
    scheme was underway in 1995 and 1996 when you were the trusted
    elected official acting as Houston County District Attorney?
    (2) All of the planning and execution of the scheme took place
    on your watch. If you didn&rsquo;t know about it, do you think
    you should have known?</p>

    <p>Judge Lukemire didn&rsquo;t answer any questions in his
    reply. He acted as though he would be the judge if this case
    were brought to trial and he said he can only discuss an issue
    with both sides of that issue present. Believe me, it never
    occured to me that he would take the position of being a judge
    in this case because he would be in a position of the greatest
    conflict of interest of all time. I was thinking of him being a
    witness or a defendant.</p>

    <p>Free and honest elections are the foundation of our form of
    govenment. This privilige was won for us by the sacrifces of
    our fighting men and women on the battle fields around the
    world. We honor them by our celebration of Memorial Day and
    Veterans Day and by thanking them every day of the year. These
    people involved in this <b>ELECTION FRAUD</b> have shown
    contempt to all our Houston County citizens and particular
    contempt to our veterans and their families who have sacrificed
    so much for us. It is past time that we showed our contempt for
    the felons that committed <b>ELECTION FRAUD</b> and bring them
    to trial in a court of law. I want them to have their day in
    court and have a chance to defend themselves. It is more than
    the citizens of Houston county got from the <b>ELECTION
    FRAUD</b> people and the newspaper media that continues to try
    to keep the truth from Houston county citizens.</p>

    <p>The very first television report about this <b>ELECTION
    FRAUD</b> crime was shown on WMAZ-TV in Macon, Georgia on 2
    June and 3 June, 2002. The reporter on that program was Nicole
    Foerschler. I appreciate her efforts. I know that a lot of
    people saw that program by the response that I am getting.I
    hope that WMAZ will continue to investigate this crime and
    bring the truth to the people. It would be a great thing if
    other television stations decided to live up to their
    responsibility and help to expose the crimes of our elected and
    appointed officials. After all, it is the responsibiliy of the
    press to expose the political corruption to the people. The
    Middle Georgia newspapers have been asked to do their job and
    they continue to refuse so it is hopeless to ask anymore.</p>

    <p>The <i>Buyers&rsquo; Guide</i> editor,David Cranshaw,
    reneged on a promise to expose the election fraud scheme in
    July, 2000. When he decided that he would not publish the truth
    about the election fraud scheme, I knew that I had to start a
    newsletter called <i>The Houston County Truth</i> if the people
    of Houston county were to learn of the betrayal by their
    elected officials and the news media of Middle Georgia.</p>

    <p>All of the people of Houston county are going to have to
    step up and help clean up the corruption by our elected
    officials and the cover up by the media. What can you do? Ask
    the people involved why they did it. Ask them to search their
    conscience and do what is necessary to make things right. This
    won&rsquo;t work for the ringleaders because they have no
    conscience. Some of these people probably just went along to
    get along. Now is the time for these people to apologize and
    ask for forgiveness. All of these people in office now should
    resign. All of the people involved should never be elected to
    any office or appointed to any government position again. Ask
    the media to do their job honorably.</p>

    <p>All of the people involved in the Election Fraud scheme and
    the coverup are weak and immoral people. If they had any
    conscience or feelings of regret about their betrayal of their
    oath of office and bringing shame to their families, they would
    apologize to the people of Houston county and turn themselves
    in to the proper authorities. Proper authorities does not mean
    Houston County District Attorney Kelly Burke or Houston County
    Superior Court Judge Ed Lukemire or retired Senior
    &ldquo;Judge&rdquo; Buster McConnell. They would probably have
    to go out of county at least to find a proper authority we
    could depend on.</p>

    <p>If we could get them in a court of law, these people would
    run over each other to rat on the others to get a reduced
    sentence. Right now they are relying on their cronies in
    positions of authority and trust to protect them. So far, it
    has worked pretty good as far as the law enforcement and media
    coverup is concerned. ......so far!</p>

    <p>Perhaps the biggest disapointment in this <b>Election
    Fraud</b> scheme is the involvement of some of the people that
    betrayed us at the beginning. Their names have been mentioned
    earlier in this volume three of the <i>Houston County
    Truth.</i></p>

    <p>Two people who were not involved with this <b>Election
    Fraud</b> at the beginning and deceived me and other people
    into believing that they would never have anything to do with a
    criminal enterprise like that were Ned Sanders and Gloria
    Alday. This was before either was elected to office. I
    campaigned for both of these people and helped get them get
    elected to office. Both are now on the Houston County Board of
    Commissioners. I told people how honorable they were and that
    they would never have anything to do with that criminal
    enterprise known as SPLOST because it hurt the people of
    Houston County. As soon as they were put in office, Ned and
    Gloria became political bedfellows with the <b>Election
    Fraud</b> crowd. I would like to apologize to everybody that I
    asked to support Ned or Gloria. I have apologized to many of
    you personally but I know I missed a lot of you. Ned and Gloria
    are running against each other for the position of Chairman of
    the County Board of Commissioners. We need a ballot option
    called &ldquo;none of the above&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Years ago in the 1920s and the 1930s in Chicago and New York
    City, criminal gangs tried to work together by sharing the
    profits from different illegal activities instead of killing
    each other. One gang would run the prostitution in the cities,
    and another gang would run the bootlegging of illegal booze,
    and another gang would run the gambling rackets and so on. The
    plan failed.The commissioners came up with a scheme for another
    SPLOST referendum based on what their counterparts had done in
    Chicago and New York.</p>

    <p>They made a deal with the politicians in the Houston county
    cities of Warner Robins, Perry, and Centerville that they would
    share the loot if the politicians would help get another sales
    tax referendum passed so the people would continue to be taxed
    at an obscene rate. It was passed. This County Commission is
    just as obscene as the one in 1996.</p>

    <p>The <i>Macon Telegraph</i> published part of a&rdquo; letter
    to the editor&rdquo; on Sunday 7 July 2002 about how the
    <b>Election Fraud</b> had a negative effect on our tax cap.
    This was the first time that even a part of a &rdquo;letter to
    the editor&rdquo; that mentions this <b>Election Fraud</b> has
    been published in a Middle Georgia newspaper. It was written by
    a man named M.Tony Anthony. The editors added a note after the
    letter that said:&rdquo;The Houston County tax cap is still in
    effect as reported in the <i>Macon Telegraph</i> - The
    Editors&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Whoa there, Mr.Editors. The tax cap is a mere shadow of its
    former self since the Sales Tax provision was removed by a
    <b>secret</b> paragraph added to the end of the educational
    Constitutional Amendment in 1996 by our dishonorable State
    Senator and our dishonorable State Representatives and others.
    Remember, the Sales Tax provision required an equal
    <b>decrease</b> in <u>property</u> taxes if <u>sales</u> taxes
    were <b>increased.</b></p>

    <p>I hope that more people will contact the media and law
    enforcement people that they know who care about our country
    and its form of government and let them know that the people of
    Houston county need some help in removing people from office
    and bringing them into a court of law. This situation is an
    outrage.</p>

    <p>I am going to end this newsletter with a comforting thought.
    All of these people involved in this conspiracy to commit
    <b>Election Fraud</b> against their neighbors and fellow
    citizens of Houston county know that they and their fellow
    conspirators are people completely without morals, honor, or
    integrity. Anybody who can do what they have done to their
    fellow citizens is capable of doing anything to anybody at
    anytime anywhere whether it is legal or illegal, moral or
    immoral, decent or indecent. How can any of these people trust
    each other to have morals, honor, or integrity when they visit
    each others home and family.?Quite a problem for them. Kind of
    brings a smile to your face, doesn&rsquo;t it?</p><br />
