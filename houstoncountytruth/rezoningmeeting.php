<h2 class="headlne">Houston County Commission decision about rezoning at second meeting could have been illegal. </h2>

<p> 11 September 2003 </p>
<P><FONT SIZE=3>Editor:<BR>
<BR>
On August 5<SUP>th</SUP>, I attended a meeting of the Houston County Commission to speak against two re-zoning petitions for two tracts along Sandefur Road and Lake Joy Road. <BR>
<BR>
The first request was to re-zone 59.31 acres from R-1 to R2.  The second request was to re-zone 32.21 acres from R-1 to R-3.  The first request was approved by the Board of Commissioners.<BR>
<BR>
I do not oppose development of the property in question.  Rather, I am opposed to the re-zoning requests because of the density of housing that the requested new zoning would permit.  In fact, the maps presented by the developer at that meeting revealed that 295 homes were to be built on the 91.52 acres.  Therefore, my opposition arises because it is in the interests of all current and future residents of Houston County that future development takes into consideration the negative aspects of high density development.  The elements that arise as a result of this request that create my concern and my opposition to the current requests are:<BR>
<BR>
<OL>
<LI TYPE="1">This request has been made noting the need for entry level housing in Houston County as a means to prevent the closing of Robins AFB as a result of any future BRAC actions.  This is nonsense!  There are entry level subdivisions currently being developed and proposed to be developed throughout the northern half of Houston County.  Their locations are along highway 96, Lakeview Road, Feagin Mill Road, Houston Lake Road, and many others.  There simply is not a need for more &#147;entry level&#148; housing.  This is especially true when there is an abundance of existing housing that offers much more square footage for a lower price than new construction &#147;entry level&#148; housing.<BR>
</OL>
<BR>
<OL>
<LI TYPE="1">There is already an overwhelming problem with drainage as a result of the ever increasing development that has occurred in the immediate past.  Apparently, there is no program within the county to adequately address the problem.  As an example, on the late afternoon of July 18, a shower of short duration created a flooding of properties in the vicinity of the intersection of highway 96 and Houston Lake Road.  As a result, several parking lots had to be closed.<BR>
</OL>
<BR>
Another example of the problems created by flooding created by and exacerbated by rapid development can be cited by reference to the problems encountered by residents of Peachtree Estates.  Whenever they sought resolution for their problems, they found themselves getting the old run around.  It isn&#146;t the county&#146;s problem.  Developers stated that is wasn&#146;t their problem to fix, it was the county&#146;s problem to correct.  In the end, residents are faced with no support to resolve their problems.  <BR>
<BR>
<OL>
<LI TYPE="1">In reference to Lake Joy Road, recent development and already approved re-zoning applications will add another 1000 homes along either side of the road from the intersection of highway 96 and Lake Joy Road (83 single family units and 300 apartment units) to the south end just north of highway 127 (already approved for multi-family housing).  Langston Road has another subdivision with nearly 200 houses to be built in the near future.  Much of the traffic from there will travel north along Lake Joy to reach the more industrialized areas of Warner Robins and Robins AFB.  Mallard&#146;s Landing is still being completed.  Expansion of Cardinal Ridge and Royal Oaks at their intersections to Sandefur Road will add more traffic to Lake Joy.<BR>
</OL>
<BR>
At the moment, I am unaware of any plans to expand Lake Joy Road in the near future.  That leaves the existing road, with its limited capacity, to handle several thousand more vehicle transits each day.  Already, accidents are on the increase.  This is simply not an acceptable situation.<BR>
<BR>
<OL>
<LI TYPE="1">Continued development of high density subdivisions will create huge demands upon an already stressed to capacity school system.  We build new schools and place trailers at the front door upon their opening.  We have a shortage of teachers, with the demands of the federal &#147;No Child Left Behind&#148; program.  The state has cut its funding for education, due to its budgetary shortfalls.  That leaves Houston County residents to be confronted with one SPLOST after another. Additionally, there can be little doubt that increasing millage rates by the Board of Education to meet the ever increasing expenses will have to be given serious consideration. These tax burdens fall heavily upon an already overtaxed populace.  And, it should be noted a large percentage of our residents are retirees, living on a fixed income <BR>
</OL>
<BR>
<OL>
<LI TYPE="1">The air quality of the Macon metropolitan area is already among the worst in the nation.  At the moment, I believe that Houston County is not under federal or state mandate to improve its air quality.  But, we are in certain danger of falling under those guidelines as long as we continue the unabated development. That would cost our taxpayers millions of dollars to correct.  If it is ever corrected to the satisfaction of EPA, EPD, and environmentalists.  Further complicating the situation for Houston County is the lack of any mass transit system to alleviate the problem created by the influx of so many additional automobiles.  Unfortunately, the way the county has been developed would probably make a mass transit system not economically feasible. <BR>

<LI TYPE="1">The quality of life of our residents must be a consideration, when proposing residential or commercial development.  As you know, there is a Green Space project, whereby counties set aside 20 percent of their land from development to provide for an enhanced quality of life for residents.  <BR>
</OL>
<BR>
At the present, we are in the unenviable position of having wall-to-wall residential and commercial development from north of highway 127 to the Bibb County line.  There seems to be no thought given for anything but building more subdivisions, more strip malls, more acres and acres of asphalt and concrete (At least that will provide us with more temporary lakes and streams.  Some close enough to be enjoyed from our living rooms.)<BR>
<BR>
Tonight, August 19<SUP>th</SUP>, I had the pleasure of attending another meeting of the Houston County Commission.  The first item on the agenda was re-zoning application 1282.  This application was for the 32.21 acres to be rezoned from R-1 to R-3.<BR>
<BR>
At the Commissioners&#146; meeting on August 5<SUP>th</SUP>, a motion was made to approve the petition.  The motion died for lack of a second.<BR>
<BR>
After that meeting, the Chairman decided that the Board had to take the matter under consideration at tonight&#146;s meeting since, in his opinion, no action had been taken on the matter previously.  That begs the question, &#147;Why didn&#146;t you state that at the meeting of August 5<SUP>th</SUP>?&#148;  The answer should be self-evident.  Action was taken.  The Board in choosing not to second the motion, in effect denied the motion.<BR>
<BR>
At this evening&#146;s meeting, a motion was made and approved to send the petition back to the planning and zoning board.  The commissioner making the motion did so because in his words &#147;in speaking with the other commissioners there was not enough votes to approve the petition.&#148;  That brings to mind another question:  Was there a meeting of our commissioners in violation of the state&#146;s Sunshine Laws?<BR>
<BR>
Why send the matter back to the P&amp;Z board?  Is it simply in hopes that the opposition will go away?  Maybe in time the other commissioners will see the error of their way and change their minds?  <BR>
<BR>
Whatever the answer to those questions is only one of speculation.  The current issue is whether the Chairman acted legally in bringing this matter back to consideration in violation of the Comprehensive Land Development Regulations for Houston County.  I will seek to find a definitive answer to that question.  If the Board acted illegally, I would expect legal action to be taken to correct the matter.<BR>
