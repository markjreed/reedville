  <h3><b>ELECTION FRAUD</b>-- THE STORY OF POLITICAL , MEDIA, and
  LAW ENFORCEMENT CORRUPTION and MALFEASANCE in HOUSTON COUNTY,
  MIDDLE GEORGIA, and the STATE OF GEORGIA.</h3>

  <p>Unfortunately, this is a true story that the other print media
  in and around Houston County refuse to publish or are not allowed
  to publish. The print media include the <i>Macon Telegraph</i>,
  <i>Warner Robins Daily Sun</i>, <i>Warner Robins Buyers'
  Guide</i>, <i>Byron Gazette</i>, and <i>Houston Home Journal</i>.
  The Houston Home Journal is owned by Evans Newspapers while the
  other four print media are owned and controlled by Knight-Ridder.
  Did anyone really believe it when it was announced that each of
  these Knight-Ridder newspapers would be independent and not under
  outside control? This is a story of contempt for our citizens by
  our elected officials.</p>

  <p>All four Knight-Ridder newspapers will not or cannot publish a
  story about Houston County elected officials committing
  <b>ELECTION FRAUD</b> in 1996 against the citizens of Houston
  County even though they have the information to conduct their own
  investigation if they wish.The Houston Home Journal also decided
  not to participate in publishing the truth about the <b>ELECTION
  FRAUD</b>. I know that the people at these newspapers have the
  required information to either publish the information as it was
  given to them or to do their own investigation into the matter
  because it is their duty as journalists. I know they have the
  information because I gave it to them. Instead, they have decided
  to censor me and ignore their duty to inform the people of
  Houston County of any government corruption or malfeasance they
  discover.</p>

  <p>Here is a definition of <b>fraud</b>:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <i>The concealment of what should have been disclosed that
    deceives or is intended to deceive another so that he shall act
    upon it to his legal injury-- also called <b>Actual
    Fraud</b>.</i>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Here is the 1996 <b>ELECTION FRAUD</b> scheme: In the General
  Election in November, 1996, a proposed amendment to the Georgia
  Constitution to allow County school districts to hold sales tax
  referendums to benefit county schools was on the ballot. The
  amendment passed. However, voters in Houston County did not know
  that a confusing and hard to read and understand paragraph had
  been <b>SECRETLY</b> added to the end of the Education Amendment
  by our dishonorable Houston County State Legislators. This
  <b>SECRET</b> paragraph was intended to hurt <b>only</b> the
  people of Houston County and possibly Richmond county because
  these two counties are the only counties in the state with a tax
  cap.</p>

  <p>This paragraph removed our Houston County tax cap requirement
  that any sales tax increase in Houston County had to be offset by
  a decrease in ad valorum taxes. Houston County voters were
  tricked into voting for something harmful to them without any
  chance to fight it since they didn't know that their their
  "trusted" elected officials had betrayed them. Also, another
  negative consequence of the <b>SECRET</b> paragraph was that the
  Houston County Commissioners could use some of the wording of the
  <b>SECRET</b> paragraph as their authority to call for another
  sales tax referendum to pay for a new jail and courthouse without
  having to decrease ad valorum taxes as called for in the tax cap.
  This allowed the Commissioners to blackmail the citizens by
  threatening to raise ad valorum taxes if the people didn't vote
  to raise sales taxes again. This <b>ELECTION FRAUD</b> prevented
  an informed vote.</p>

  <p>Judge L. A. "Buster" McConnell ordered the Commissioners to
  build a new jail and courthouse in June, 1996, and then "retired"
  three weeks later. The Commissioners could have challenged the
  "Judge's" order if just two Commissioners had been honorable
  enough to vote to challenge but they didn't because all of these
  actions by McConnell and the Commissioners were part of the
  <b>ELECTION FRAUD</b> scheme. McConnell is now "acting" as a
  Senior Superior Court "Judge" out of the reach of the voters and
  sentencing citizens to prison. Election Fraud is a felony.</p>

  <p>The <b>SECRET</b> paragraph was put into the proposed Georgia
  Constitution Education Amendment referendum resolution (HR-728)
  in January, 1996 by our dishonorable delegation. The resolution
  was passed by the General Assembly and signed by Governor Miller
  in April, 1996. The resolution was now ready to be put on the
  General Election ballot as a referendum in November, 1996.
  "Judge" Mconnell issued his order in June. 1996 and then retired.
  Our elected officials kept their <b>SECRET</b> paragraph as a
  secret among themselves and the amendment was passed in November,
  1996, and the <b>ELECTION FRAUD</b> against Houston County had
  succeeded. No citizen knew about the fraud until August, 1997.
  Steve Elkins reported it in the August, 1997 edition of the
  Elkins' Report. ( Great reporter )</p>

  <p>Houston County Officials who actively participated or had to
  know about the <b>ELECTION FRAUD</b> scheme and kept it a secret
  from the people were: "Judge" McConnell, State Senator Sonny
  Perdue, Houston County State Representives: Larry Walker, Sonny
  Watson, Johnny Floyd, and Robert Ray. Houston County
  Commissioners: the late Sherrill Stafford, Larry Snellgrove, Jay
  Walker, Jim Carter, and Calvin Mayes. Also, Houston County
  Attorney Mike Long had to know. County School Board members: Tina
  Fletcher,Gary McClure, Hubert Hutchinson, Fred Wilson, Skip
  Talbert, Shirley Lowery, and Dave Davidson. Also, County School
  Superintendent Tony Hinnant and School Board Attorney Billy
  Jerles had to know.</p>

  <p>I sent a five page report to the Georgia Attorney General and
  Georgia Secretary of State in June and July, 1998, respectively,
  asking for an investigation in this <b>ELECTION FRAUD</b>. They
  both refused and basically told me to get a lawyer and sue these
  <b>ELECTION FRAUD</b> people. I want a criminal trial first. I
  spoke about this matter at the Board of Education forums at
  Warner Robins High School on 27 April 00 and Perry High School on
  4 May 00. I also distributed copies of my report and refusal
  letters from Attorney General and Secretary of State at both
  forums. The Macon Telegraph, Warner Robins Daily Sun, Warner
  Robins Buyers' Guide, and Houston Home Journal all had reporters
  at these forums but none of them have ever reported that a
  citizen had accused the School Board and these other people of
  <b>ELECTION FRAUD</b> at the forums. The Secretary of State
  refused again in June, 2000. With all of this media and law
  enforcement cover-up and corruption, no wonder our elected
  officials thought they would get away with it. I think a local
  investigation is in order. Ask our candidates running for Houston
  County District Attorney, Kelly Burke, and Jack Kemp, if they
  will conduct an honest and thorough investigation if elected.</p>
