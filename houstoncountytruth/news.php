<li><b>17 February 2006</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>-- THE  PERPETUAL  SPLOST IS  BACK  AGAIN.</b> The tax and spend crowd from the Houston County, Georgia Commission is back again with another referendum to keep the sales tax at 7 % for another six years ending in 2012.</p>

<p>The referendum will be held on Tuesday, 21 March 2006 and will continue to drain the taxpayers dry in Houston county if the Special Local Option Sales Tax (SPLOST) passes. The voters of Houston county have got to go to the polls and vote <b><b>NO</b></b> on this referendum. This criminal nonsense has got to stop.</P>

<p> From this point on, you will notice a definite similiarity between this article and the one that follows dated<b> 17 September 2005.</b> The two articles are similiar because the  SPLOST for the County Commission and the SPLOST for the School Board  are tied together as part of an election fraud scheme by our Houston county elected officials. TRUTH NEVER CHANGES. Read on.

<p>The Houston County School Board is still collecting on a one-cent sales tax from a referendum passed in 2001. The School Board will continue to collect a one-cent sales tax until the year 2012 because of a referendum passed on 20 September 2005. On top of that, the Houston County School Board has been getting a one-cent sales tax since 1983 as part of the Tax Cap Constitutional Amendment passed for Houston county in 1982. The tax cap amendment also stated that if the sales taxes were ever increased in Houston county, the property taxes would have to be decreased by the same amount.</p>

<p>The property taxes have not been decreased in Houston county even though sales taxes have been increased due to SPLOST referendums put on the ballot by both the School Board <b>and</b> the County Commission.</p>

<p>Why didn't the property taxes have to be decreased in accordance with the Tax Cap Amendment passed for Houston county in 1982? It is because our "trusted" elected officials from Houston county added a secret paragraph at the end of a statewide Constitutional Amendment put on the ballot in 1996. The amendment was about allowing school districts to hold referendums about raising sales taxes to build and maintain schools. The secret paragraph was not made public in any way and was written in such a manner that no honest, interested citizen not involved with our elected officials would know about it.</p>

<p>These "trusted" elected officials committed<b> ELECTION FRAUD.</b> These people have never even been questioned by Houston County District Attorney Kelly Burke even though I have requested it many times. He seems determined to protect his "people". Mr. Burke's behavior is as reprehensible as the people who committed election fraud. These people seem to think they are above the law. So far, they have been right.</p>

<p>To decide for yourself, go back to the index page of this website and click on "report" and then read the report that was given to Mr. Burke. This report is the request for an investigation of election fraud sent to the Georgia Attorney General and Georgia Secretary of State. You can make a judgement about what happened and let all of them stand up in the court of public opinion. That may be the best we will ever get. But then again, you never  know.</p>

<p><b> PLEASE  VOTE  "NO   SPLOST"</p></b></li>

   <hr /><li><b>20 May 2005</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>--PROTEST AGAINST JUDICIAL INJUSTICE--</b>  A group of Georgia citizens marched at the Houston County  Courthouse in Perry, Georgia,yesterday to protest what they see as unfair treatment by Superior Court judges in Houston county. The group consisted of fathers, mothers, and grandparents who were upset at child-custody decisions made by Judges L. A. "Buster" McConnell,George Nunn, and Edward Lukemire. They feel that many decisions were made because of the judges' personal connections to the other party or their personal prejudice against the people that were ruled against instead of ruling on the merits of the case. They contend that these decisions have been detrimental to the safety and overall well-being of the child.</p>

<p>The protesters say that judicial reform is needed now if the people will ever be able to get a fair hearing in a court of law in Houston county and other parts of Georgia. Other protesters were concerned about the general breakdown of ethics, fairness, honor, and justice in the administration of justice in our judicial system. They say that corruption runs rampant throughout our courts and other parts of our law enforcement and political system from our county district attornies to the state attorney generals to the governors' offices.</p>

<p>The protesters vow to keep marching in other parts of the state as well as Houston county until all people are treated fairly and decently in our courts. Stay tuned.</li>

       available, covering <b>SONNY PERDUE's BIG CON JOB</b>.</li>

    <hr /><li><b>8 August 2002</b> Breaking news---Give credit where
      credit is due. A new Houston County shoppers newspaper called
      <b><i>Buyers' Connection</i></b> has broken the Middle
      Georgia newspapers' almost complete blackout of any mention
      of the <b>ELECTION FRAUD</b> committed by Houston County
      elected officials in 1996. The Macon Telegraph published an
      article on 15 June 2001 and that has been it for the entire
      six years for all of the newspapers in Middle Georgia. They
      have known about it since I published my report to the
      Georgia Attorney General in June, 1998. No "letters to the
      editor" have been allowed to get through in recent years. The
      newspapers have also refused to live up to their journalistic
      responsibility to keep the citizens informed of possible
      wrongdoing by elected officials. Journalists are supposed to
      be the protectors of the people against a government that has
      gone bad and has intentions of abusing our laws and our
      people. Our newspaper people in Middle Georgia have decided
      to be the protectors of our elected officials who have abused
      our election laws which are the foundation of our form of
      government.</p>

      <p>The <i>Buyers' Connection</i> published a letter sent in
      by a citizen who wanted some answers about this ELECTION
      FRAUD matter that is the basis for my newsletter, THE HOUSTON
      COUNTY TRUTH, and also this web site. They also published a
      response from our Houston County District Attorney, Mr. Kelly
      Burke. He says they have not done any thing illegal. I take
      exception with just about every statement he made in his
      response. This is the first time Mr. Burke has made a public
      response about this matter even though I have asked him many
      times to investigate this ELECTION FRAUD but he has refused.
      I gather from the editor's comments that the response was
      written by Mr. Burke and was also a response for the Houston
      County Commissioners and tax officials. The response was a
      great work of <b>fiction</b> and <b>fantasy.</b> They are
      learning that it is difficult to defend the indefensible.
      Even though the <b>Buyers' Connection</b> editor and District
      Attorney Burke may disagree with me, all I ever wanted was an
      investigation by a duly elected law enforcement official and
      have the case tried in a court of law. Just let the case be
      judged by a jury of their peers and let the chips fall where
      they may. I want these people to have a chance to defend
      themselves. That is more than the citizens of Houston County
      got from them.</p>

      <p>If I can't get the law enforcement people to do their job
      and conduct an investigation, I think it would be in the
      public interest to have a public debate between Mr. Burke and
      me.That way I could defend my position and he could defend
      his position.At this time, I am considering issuing a formal
      challenge to Mr. Burke to debate and let the people decide
      what the truth is. Do you suppose he would be willing?
      Perhaps some civic organization would be interested in
      holding this debate in the public interest. I do believe it
      would be very interesting. We could call it "Civics 101". I
      hope everyone will try to get a copy of the <b>Buyers'
      Connection</b> and read the letter and response for
      themselves. It is dated August 6 - August 12, 2002. The phone
      number at the <b>Buyers' Connection</b> is 478-329-1005 and
      it is a free newspaper set up in vending machines throughout
      Houston County. I thank the <b>Buyers' Connection</b> for
      publishing this information as a public service. That is what
      newspapers are supposed to be about. There is no longer any
      need for the other newspapers to completely cover up this
      ELECTION FRAUD. People throughout Houston County know about
      it now. Let the sunshine in!!!</p>

      <p><b>25 November 2001</b> The sales tax goes back up to 7%
      in Houston County because some ill- informed people and some
      lying people in and out of public office voted for it in a
      referendum held on November 6, 2001. The referendum was
      called for by the Houston County Board of Education (also
      known as Mob #2). Contrary to the deliberate lies spread by
      Jack Steed and his ilk and the local media, the county sales
      tax had gone back to 6% on October 1, 2001. Steed is Chairman
      of the "Tell Any Lie Committee for more Taxes in Houston
      County". The last tax increase for the Board of Education had
      ended on October 1 according to law. Steed and his gang
      continued to spread his lies which said that passing this tax
      referendum would not be a tax increase. (See "Letters to
      editor", <i>Macon Telegraph</i>, 5 November 2001. Also see
      pamphlet mailed to Houston County citizens around the first
      of November, 2001.) They did that right up to referendum
      day.</p>

      <p>Steed had to figure that a good portion of the YES vote
      would come from the sheep that follow without thinking and
      depend on people like Steed and the ELECTION FRAUD crowd to
      do their thinking for them. People who voted for this tax
      increase voted to continue a criminal enterprise. The new
      taxes collected will be dirty money stolen from the people.
      The Board of Education has already come out of the closet and
      is now trying to waste four million by hiring "consultants"
      or "monitors" or whatever. Nothing was mentioned about this
      waste before the referendum. There is a stench about this
      that does not surprise anybody that has been paying
      attention. What happened to the insincere whine: "We have to
      get this money for the children"? FOLLOW THE MONEY!!</p>
    </li>

    <hr /><li>
      <p><b>24 June 2001</b> The criminal enterprise known as the
      Special Local Option Sales Tax (SPLOST) was passed on 19
      June, 2001. This means that the sales tax in Houston County,
      Georgia stays at 7% for another five years or until Mob#1,
      the commissioners, collect 85 million dollars from the
      people. That is , it stays at 7% if Mob#2 (Board of
      Education) can con the people in November into voting yes to
      extending their current SPLOST of one percent for an unknown
      number of years for an unknown number of millions of dollars.
      If the eighty percent of registered voters stay home like
      they did on 19 June, it will pass again. This eighty percent
      has got to vote and vote NO in order to stop this madness.
      Houston County SPLOST was born of a criminal act and is
      illegal as well as immoral. Read the rest of the information
      in the Houston County Truth to see what we mean.</p>
