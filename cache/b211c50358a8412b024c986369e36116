<p>&lt;BillCosby&gt;<i>Riiiiight.</i>&lt;/BillCosby&gt;</p>

<p>OK, so I don't do anything manlier than home repair, and even then, I'm impressed with myself if I can patch a hole in drywall and not be able to point out the spot where it used to be from 11 yards away<a href="#note1" name="ref1" style="vertical-align: super; font-size: x-small" rel="nofollow">1</a>.  Nonetheless, somehow I found myself at a shooting range on a Friday night, making holes in a paper silhouette with a Glock 9mm.</p>

<p>This happened courtesy of my friend Eric, who - despite being a skinny computer geek - participates in things like scuba diving and paintball and other <i>(shudder)</i> physical activities.  I know, right?</p>

<p>Anyway, I was supposed to go to Jody's company holiday party, but the logistics failed to work out.  As we'd already arranged a babysitter in the person of the Right Honorable Thomas Seaver, I called up Eric and suggested a Guys' Night Out.  He in turn suggested the gun range as our destination.</p>

<p>This is a new entry in his manly-pastime schedule; he's only been at it for a couple weeks, although has already managed to squeeze in five visits to the range and has purchased his own personal sets of ear and eye protection.  It has been on my "to try" list for a while, so I figured, what the heck.  Lower barrier to entry than paintball.  So off we went.</p>

<p>Now, Eric, as I said, has all of two weeks on me in this sport, but nonetheless decided to pull an Obi-Wan and take charge of my teaching himself.  Spoiler Alert: this worked out better than it did for ol' Ben, as I have so far not turned to the dark side or killed anyone, even accidentally. It probably helped that I already knew basic gun safety<a href="#note2" name="ref2" style="vertical-align: super; font-size: x-small" rel="nofollow">2</a>.</p>

<p>First impressions: holy crap, is it easy to get in.  You just walk up to the counter, hand them your driver's license, and walk away with a gun and ammunition.  They didn't do a background check, or even make me listen to a safety lecture!</p>

<p>(Attention, criminals: this is, however, not a recommended way to acquire a gun and ammunition.  First, there's that whole surrendering-your-driver's license thing, but beyond that, you're in a building full of people who either have a gun in their hands or several guns within arm's reach.  Not a good place to make a run for it.)</p>

<p>So there I was, carrying a real, live gun and a box of bullets.  We walked through an airlock-style arrangement of doors designed to keep the lound booms from making it out to where people aren't wearing earmuffs, and there was the range.  It's a big, long, concrete room with a row of stalls across the short dimension, each with a clothesline-type arrangement for moving the paper targets out to the desired distance, and red stripes on the floor marking off every 2½ yards.  I was going to let Eric go first - the ol' watch-and-learn - but he told me to go for it.  Yikes!</p>

<p>We started with a .22-caliber revolver.  .22-caliber bullets are relatively small<a href="#note4" name="ref4" style="font-size:x-small;vertical-align:super" rel="nofollow">4</a>.  They are so small, in fact, that the cylinder holds ten shells instead of six, which I assume is a feature specifically designed for shootouts with the type of smartass who counts their adversary's shots.  "Ha-HA!", they cry, leaping out from behind their cover. " You're all out of... " <b>BLAM!</b></p>

<p>Eric reiterated the Prime Directive of range safety (keep the gun pointed downrange at all times), showed me how to load the gun, and then put me into a basic stance.  Having recently watched an episode of Mythbusters that featured shooting stances, I decided to try showing off: "This is called the 'Weaver', right?" "Nope, this is the Isosceles."  Smackdown!</p>

<p>Having been given basic instruction by Eric, my thoughts during that first shot went something like this: "OK, pick up the gun, hand on the grip, finger straight out along the barrel.  Feet shoulder-width apart, arms out, bent a little at the elbows.  Left hand comes up to support the gun.  Line up the sights.  Pull back the hammer. Move finger onto trigger.  Breathe in.  Start to breathe out.  Give the trigger a gentle squ<b>BOOM!</b>eeze?"</p>

<p>It took several seconds for me to remember to finish breathing out.  That's how I learned that there's not much travel left in that trigger once the hammer is cocked.  I've heard the term "hair-trigger", but now I know what it feels like.</p>

<p>I did all right with my first grouping, but despite the relatively light weight of the gun, my arms got tired fast, and my shots spread out on the target like an expanding cloud.  After 50 rounds, I yielded the lane to Eric, who proceeded to show me up.  After he'd also shot his way through 50 rounds, we traded the revolver in for a Glock 9mm, a.k.a. "generic TV gun".  These shells were a lot bigger, but it still held ten at a time.  (Not being a revolver helps.)</p>

<p>The Glock's trigger, unlike the revolver's, was not a mindreader; I definitely had to squeeze with intent to get the gun to fire.  So I wasn't so surprised by the timing when it went off.  Instead, I was surprised by the very-much-louder boom.  And the recoil.  And the fact that the spent cartridge went flying up and out as if a tiny kicker had punted it from inside the chamber.  You didn't prepare me for that, TV!</p>

<p>I was pleased to see that my shot had poked a hole right through the X in the middle of the silhouette target.  My next two, however, were outside of the red zone entirely, in the 9 ring. Eric said that's because the gun surprised me with its power and I was now afraid of it.</p>

<p>Now, if you're going to pick something to be afraid of, guns aren't the worst choice, but it is kind of silly, not to mention counterproductive, to be afraid of the one you yourself are trying to shoot.  Eric advised me to relax: "The gun won't hurt you."  (This was not entirely true, as I accidentally put a thumb behind the slide on one of my shots.  Pro tip: this is not recommended.) So I took a break and centered myself, and likewise centered my next several shots.  All together, out of 20 shots aimed at the center from 7½ to 10 yards, 18 were in the red, and 11 of those were in or on the innermost ring. Not bad for a first-timer.</p>

Anyway, after Eric took his shots, we turned our stuff in, paid the bill, washed the dust off our hands and faces, and went to dinner.

What I learned: guns are freaking loud, shooting them can in fact be fun, and I don't totally suck at it.  Good to know.

One of the first ones he took down was Monopoly, but we never finished the game we started.<a name="ref1" href="#note1" rel="nofollow"><sup style="font-size: xx-small">1</sup></a><br /><br />Then he found <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pente" rel="nofollow">Pente</a>, which, as another five-in-a-row game, was more of a hit; our kids have always been fans of Tic-Tac-Toe.  Regular readers will recall how <a href="http://mightybear.livejournal.com/155832.html" rel="nofollow">Connor beat Mommy</a> at the game when she attempted to prove to him that it was impossible to win against an awake opponent &mdash; and then forgot to stay awake.   <br /><br />This week, however, Connor seemed focused on the games of the Far East, otherwise known as "Games Daddy owns and knows the rules to but can't actually play very well".<a name="ref2" href="#note2" rel="nofollow"><sup style="font-size: xx-small">2</sup></a> On Sunday, we played <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xiangqi" rel="nofollow">Chinese chess (<i>xi&agrave;ng q&iacute;</i>)</a>, and then last night it was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(game)" rel="nofollow">Go</a>.  When I mentioned that Go was originally a Chinese game, and they called it <i>w&eacute;i q&iacute;</i>, Connor said, "So <i>q&iacute;</i> means 'game'!"  Smart kid.<br /><br />Of course, he then asked me what <i>xi&agrave;ng</i> and <i>w&eacute;i</i> mean.  I should have expected that &mdash;  dumb dad.<a name="ref3" href="#note3" rel="nofollow"><sup style="font-size: xx-small">3</sup></a><br /><br />Chase likes these games, too, and he and I had a fun game of 6x6 Go last night.  But he'd be just as happy playing Uno; Connor is the instigator when it comes to variety.  It's not just the abstracts, either; he's a fan of themed games like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RoboRally" rel="nofollow">RoboRally</a>, too.   He also likes card games, especially <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominion_(game)" rel="nofollow">Dominion</a>.<br /><br />So both of them like their games, and it's nice that I can usually tempt them off the PC or Wii to play something more physical.<br /><br />Not <i>too</i> physical, though; I'm sure this is a shock, given their parents, but neither kid is much into the sports.  We are trying to encourage them to stay fit, though, and Connor is taking the Presidential fitness challenge this semester.   After the first session, I asked him how it went, and he said, "Great!  I couldn't do a single pull-up!  I just hung there until they came and got me down!"<br /><br />That's my boy! <br /><hr /><br /><div style="font-size:small"><a name="note1" href="#ref1" rel="nofollow"><sup style="font-size: xx-small">1</sup></a>I carefully recorded the game state so we could resume it at some point.

The more common meaning and usual answer is "elephant"; besides appearing in the name of the game, it's also what they call the two pieces that correspond to the bishops in western chess - which were called "elephants" in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaturanga" rel="nofollow">the original game</a> that both versions of chess descend from.

Regular readers will recall how <a href="http://mightybear.livejournal.com/155832.html" rel="nofollow">Connor beat Mommy</a> at the game when she attempted to prove to him that it was impossible to win against an awake opponent &mdash; and then forgot to stay awake.   <br /><br />This week, however, Connor seemed focused on the games of the Far East, otherwise known as "Games Daddy owns and knows the rules to but can't actually play very well".<a name="ref2" href="#note2" rel="nofollow"><sup style="font-size: xx-small">2</sup></a> On Sunday, we played <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xiangqi" rel="nofollow">Chinese chess (<i>xi&agrave;ng q&iacute;</i>)</a>, and then last night it was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(game)" rel="nofollow">Go</a>.  When I mentioned that Go was originally a Chinese game, and they called it <i>w&eacute;i q&iacute;</i>, Connor said, "So <i>q&iacute;</i> means 'game'!"  Smart kid.<br /><br />Of course, he then asked me what <i>xi&agrave;ng</i> and <i>w&eacute;i</i> mean.  I should have expected that &mdash;  dumb dad.<a name="ref3" href="#note3" rel="nofollow"><sup style="font-size: xx-small">3</sup></a><br /><br />Chase likes these games, too, and he and I had a fun game of 6x6 Go last night.  But he'd be just as happy playing Uno; Connor is the instigator when it comes to variety.  It's not just the abstracts, either; he's a fan of themed games like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RoboRally" rel="nofollow">RoboRally</a>, too.   He also likes card games, especially <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominion_(game)" rel="nofollow">Dominion</a>.<br /><br />So both of them like their games, and it's nice that I can usually tempt them off the PC or Wii to play something more physical.<br /><br />Not <i>too</i> physical, though; I'm sure this is a shock, given their parents, but neither kid is much into the sports.  We are trying to encourage them to stay fit, though, and Connor is taking the Presidential fitness challenge this semester.   After the first session, I asked him how it went, and he said, "Great!  I couldn't do a single pull-up!  I just hung there until they came and got me down!"<br /><br />That's my boy! <br /><hr /><br /><div style="font-size:small"><a name="note1" href="#ref1" rel="nofollow"><sup style="font-size: xx-small">1</sup></a>I carefully recorded the game state so we could resume it at some point.  Which I'm absolutely willing to do . . . if one of them brings it up.  <br /><br /><a name="note2" href="#ref2" rel="nofollow"><sup style="font-size: xx-small">2</sup></a>A category which arguably includes regular western chess, too, but as mediocre as I am at that game, I'm far worse at these.<br /><br /><a name="note3" href="#ref3" rel="nofollow"><sup style="font-size: xx-small">3</sup></a>For the record, ?<i>w&eacute;i</i> means "surround" or "enclose", so Go is "the Surrounding Game".  Things are less clear-cut in the case of Chinese chess, since the word ? <i>xi&agrave;ng</i> can mean different things depending on context.  The more common meaning and usual answer is "elephant"; besides appearing in the name of the game, it's also what they call the two pieces that correspond to the bishops in western chess - which were called "elephants" in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaturanga" rel="nofollow">the original game</a> that both versions of chess descend from.  So we'll go with "The Elephant Game".   What did parents do before the Internet?  "Good question, son.   Let's drive to the library!" ?</div>";s:14:"date_timestamp";i:1314323268;}i:3;a:9:{s:4:"guid";s:41:"http://zeekar.livejournal.com/103632.html";s:7:"pubdate";s:29:"Thu, 28 Apr 2011 00:35:30 GMT";s:5:"title";s:20:"Been a while, I see.";s:4:"link";s:41:"http://zeekar.livejournal.com/103632.html";s:11:"description";s:345:"Been letting Jody handle the blogging around here, I guess.

<dd>We've actually been watching these for a little while; our British friend Tony recommended this quirky BBC series, and we're glad he did.  Very funny show about a true crime writer who keeps conning the titular character - the genius behind a popular stage magician's illusions - into helping to solve baffling murder mysteries.  Sort of "Psych" meets "X-Files", if the latter didn't have the existence of <i>real</i> paranormal stuff as part of its premise.

<dd>This one we don't have on DVD yet; we recorded the PBS Great Performances episode.  So far we've only seen the first act.  No surprises here: Josh Groban and Idina Menzel sing the Hell out of their parts.  Menzel's "Nobody's Side" has you cheering for the cynical worldview, while Groban's rendition of "Anthem" is positively heartrending.  Adam Pascal does a pretty good job keeping up with them, as does the chorus, but the rest of the main cast tends to pale in comparison.  I'm particularly disappointed in Marti Pellow's Arbiter; he just doesn't seem to have the voice for the part.
   <p>Rice is still meddling with the book after 25 years, and it shows - this still feels like a stirring musical in search of a story. But it's good to see a lot of the things that got dropped in early changes make a comeback, like having two different tournaments a year apart in different locales, which means "Merano" is back in.  A few new numbers that were not in any previously recorded version of the show help flesh things out storywise.</p>
   <p>But - if I may put on my pedant's cap for a moment - why they moved the setting back in time five years is beyond me.  The Marketers shouldn't be singing about the Rubik's Cube craze in 1979!
