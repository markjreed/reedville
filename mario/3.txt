                               | Level 3-1 |
                               o-----------o

Head down the pipe to find the first of many Mega Cheep-Cheeps along with 
with Cheep-Cheeps, so swim through their lazy swimming patterns, finding a
Red Coin Ring to pass through, but it is very tough to swim between the
charging Cheep-Cheep types to get the Power-Up reward.  After a few more
Cheep-Cheep/Mega Cheep-Cheep attack, the halfway point will be reached, 
followed by hitting the rotating Power-Ups for the pictured Power-Up that
is on the side when it is touched.

Pass through a narrow area to see a Cheep-Chomp, a large fish that will try
to attack Mario directly by trying to eat him whole!  Swim past more 
Cheep-Cheeps to go down the pipe in the set ahead that is not blowing air, 
finding Coins, Cheep-Cheeps, and the first Star Coin.  Upon leaving the
pipe, go close to the roof, swimming through some air currents to grab the 
second Star Coin, but do not hang around there, as a Cheep-Chomp attack from
the right will occur here.  Hit the P-Switch ahead, swimming through the 
Coins near the roof ahead to get the third Star Coin, followed by swimming 
through a Red Coin Ring, but with that Cheep-Chomp following Mario, it is 
best to ignore this option and instead continue to the right to go up the 
pipe, finding the flagpole to end the level!


                               o-----------o
                               | Level 3-2 |
                               o-----------o

Raid the ? Block while fighting off the Red Koopa Troopa, followed by going
to the next toadstool to stomp the Red Koopa Troopa there, followed by
kicking him to the right and following along to get a 1-Up for the combo of
destroyed Goombas.  Use the pulley-elevator to span the gap, followed by
raiding the ? Blocks by the pipe for a Power-Up before heading down that
aforementioned pipe to find the first Star Coin.  When Mario returns to the 
main area, use the pulley-elevator sets to reach the second Star Coin high 
on a ledge, followed by leaping down to the rocking toadstool.  At this 
point the level splits into two paths, the Main Route and the Alternate 
Route.

                                ==========
                                Main Route
                                ==========

Ignore the pipes above as the rocking toadstool moves forward, getting to a
ledge and a pulley-elevator set that has a Red Coin Ring.  Grab the Red 
Coins while moving forward, breaking the pulley elevator to get the lower
Red Coins, receiving a prize in the process.  Next is another rocking 
toadstool that moves across a large gap, so fight the Green Paratroopa 
Koopas as they appear, making sure to get the third Star Coin high in the 
air, arriving at the flagpole, so hit it to end the level!

                             ===============
                             Alternate Route
                             ===============

Jump up and enter the green pipe, finding an area with a P-Switch that makes
some silver Coins appear, and once you are done here, go down the other pipe
to carefully leap across the rocking toadstools here, locating the alternate
flagpole, ending the level and opening up level 3-B!


                             o---------------o
                             | Level 3-Tower |
                             o---------------o

Use the middle pipe to launch up to the fences, grabbing the lowest fence 
area.  Head left and then up, climbing carefully past the Koopa Troopas
(punch them off the other side of the fence if you desire to), climbing up 
to find the first Star Coin.  Now head back down to the bottom of the area
again, using the center pipe to launch onto the higher portions of the 
fences, finding some Amps blocking the way forward.  Punch the door of the 
fence to swing around, climbing back to the left where the Amps are not, and 
punch again to get onto the front side of the fence once more.  Mario will
now advance upwards, turning to the left to go upward, grabbing the second
Star Coin.

Now backtrack to the previous fork in the path, going upwards past the 
Koopa Troopa and Amps to find a door in the top-right corner of the room,
where Mario will need to hit the !-Block, followed by hopping up the red 
blocks while they are solid and dodging the Koopa Troopas on the fences,
reaching the door high above, which sits near the third Star Coin!  Head 
left and raid the ? Block on the right by the fence, getting a Power-Up,
which just leaves the big doors to pass through!

Bowser Jr. attacks here as usual, charging back and forth in an attempt to
run into Mario, but this time his platform has water all underneath it, so
falling in will make it tough to get back onto the ledge without taking a
hit in the process.  The usual 3 stomps or 9 Fireballs or a combination of
the two will end the battle, chasing Bowser Jr. from another Tower!


                               o-----------o
                               | Level 3-3 |
                               o-----------o

head down the pipe to swim past the first Blooper of the game, finding a
Power-Up in a ? Block, which the game follows up with Cheep-Cheeps and more
Bloopers.  Mario will soon come across a pipe with a hole behind it, but it
is not a death hole, rather it leads downward to a Blooper that guards the
first Star Coin.  Hit the nearby ?-Switch before swimming back up to the 
area above, swimming to the right at top speed to drop down the hole by two
horizontal pipes to find a Red Coin Ring to use, followed by moving to the
right to go down the third pipe that appears, finding a room with a ton of
Bloopers, a ton of Coins, and the second Star Coin.

After grabbing what is needed from this cavern (look for a rotating Power-Up
to snag), take the pipe in the top-right corner of the room to return to the
previous area, riding the currents on the right upwards to move right, 
sinking down through the side currents.  Once Mario reaches the bottom, the
third Star Coin will be his, but be ready for an ambush by the Bloopers, so
swim upwards at full speed to get away.  Mario will get back to the area 
above the side currents, taking the pipe above to reach the flagpole, the 
end of the level!


                          o---------------------o
                          | Level 3-Ghost House |
                          o---------------------o

Head right to get a Power-Up (be ready for to to fly off on a wild angle,
requiring that Mario chase it down), heading right to hit the ?-Switch he
finds, creating a staircase to allow Mario to scale the slope ahead.  Slide
down the far side to continue past the Boos in this area to enter a door for
a Power-Up from the left ? Block.  Return to the previous area (watching out
for the Splunkin that attacks from the left), heading right to enter the 
door past the ?-Switch to get the Star Coin by Super Jumping off the 
Splunkins.

Now back outside, hitting the ?-Switch before boarding the elevator, jumping
right to take the two sets of stairs, reaching the second Star Coin at the 
top.  Fall back down the ?-Switch, hitting it and going up the first set
of stairs to find another slope to go down, reaching a ?-Switch hidden in 
the brick.  Now the level will take separate paths, so you must choose the
Main Route or the Alternate Route.

                                ==========
                                Main Route
                                ==========

Hit the ?-Switch and go back up the slope Mario just descended, entering the
door that lies down the hole.  Grab the Power-Up from the ? Block, followed
by going up the ledge on the left to find a rotating Power-Up, which will 
have to be raided for the Blue Shell to become Shell Mario.  If you 
succeeded in grabbing the Blue Shell, Mario can go after the third Star Coin
by going right, spinning up the slopes and through the Splunkins, breaking
the bricks to the right of the door to get access.  All that remains from 
there is to go through the door to grab a hold of the flagpole to end the
level!

                             ===============
                             Alternate Route
                             ===============

Hit the ?-Switch, climbing the stairs to leap over the first gap, falling 
down the stairs you climbed just previously, jumping the nearby ?-Switch to
enter the door before it disappears.  If you get through, go get onto the
flagpole to end the level, opening the way to the Warp Cannon on the map 
screen!


                               o-----------o
                               | Level 3-A |
                               o-----------o

Head right and enter the water, swimming underneath the Skeeters and their
bombs, finding a Red Coin Ring to use to get the Power-Up/1-Up that the it
awards by swimming up and going around the island.  Continue right, killing
the Skeeter that appear, finding some dotted outline of blocks, so kill the
Sketters, followed by hitting the !-Switch in the water below, allowing 
Mario to use the blocks that appear to reach the ledge above.  Grab the 
Power-Up before dropping into the water to move right, drawing the attacks
of the Skeeter, blowing the blocks away, opening the path to the first Star
Coin.

After going right to get the Mini Mushroom from the ? Block, get to the 
surface and get onto the spinning barrels, jumping right to use the Red 
Koopa Troopa as a stepping stone for a Super Jump up to the second Star Coin
above.  Continue to the right to go through a pipe, finding a stretch of 
water to cross, entering the first pipe hanging from above.  Run to the 
right across the water, taking a running leap to reach the third Star Coin 
floating high above, followed by entering the next pipe.  Head to the right
while dodging the Skeeters and Green Paratroopa Koopas, passing through the 
pipe at the end to find the flagpole!


                               o-----------o
                               | Level 3-B |
                               o-----------o

Mario will need to move past each Piranha Plant when they retreat, though
Fiery Mario will be able to burn his way through with ease.  Head right to
to find a Power-Up, followed by a Venus Fire Trap across a gap.  After
bypassing this obstacle, another Venus Fire Trap guarding a Power-Up will
soon appear, which leads to a Star Coin protected by some bricks.  head 
right to find a red pipe to go down, moving left in this area past the enemy
to find another red pipe, taking it upwards tog et that aforementioned Star
Coin before going back through the previous room to emerge into the main
area.

Leap across the gaps ahead, waiting for the Piranha Plants and Venus Fire
Traps, arriving at an area where a Star Coin twinkles above.  To the left of
this spot are two pipes, so Wall Jump off of them to pass over a pipe to 
reach that Star Coin, followed by falling down to collect a Power-Up from 
the nearby ? Block.  Next are a few four-way pipes, so pass them with 
caution, finding a Piranha Plant that guards a fall down to a lower area, so
wait for it to retreat before hopping down, collecting the final Star Coin 
for this level.  All that remains is to go right and get onto the flagpole
to end this tour through the pipes!


                               o-----------o
                               | Level 3-C |
                               o-----------o

Head right across the platforms to get a Power-Up, remembering to watch out
for the attacks from Spike Bass.  Continue moving right, taking out Red 
Koopa Trroopas and Goombas while moving off of the smaller ledges quickly 
(due to their plunging into the water), arriving at a Star Coin below some
breakaway ledges (fall down to the Star Coin, then leap back up to safety).
Next for Mario are some Coins, but each platform also has a host of 
Cheep-Cheeps that will leap into the air to try and hit him, so be careful.

Mario will find some small solid ground up ahead, signaling the halfway 
point, which is soon followed by a Power-Up in a ? Block.  Next up would be
a Star Coin in an alcove below the bridge, so hopefully you can kill the 
Spike Bass to make this an easy job, but if not, draw Spike bass out by
entering the water, leaping him to swim underneath to get the Star Coin, 
followed by hustling out to the right to get to safety.  

A P-Switch can be hit to make Coins turn solid, so speed right (ignore the 
silver Coins) to hit the block to get an Invincible Starman, rushing 
through the enemies while leaping to the right, using the now solid Coins 
(they are still bricks hopefully) to enter the pipe.  Fall through the final
Star Coin and head to the right, hitting the invisible block above the Coins
to reach the upper area of the flagpole.


                             o----------------o
                             | Level 3-Castle |
                             o----------------o

The good old fashioned Piledrivers from Super Mario World make an 
appearance here, pounding away at a blistering pace.  Move right underneath
two of the Piledrivers to find a Power-Up, followed up by running and 
leaping to the right to go under two more Piledrivers.  Wait for the next 
pile driver to retract, allowing Mario to go underneath the platform to get 
the Star Coin, hiding there until the pile driver comes and goes, opening 
the leap to the right.

Pass the Dry Bones to leap between the two Piledrivers, noting that if you
get stuck in between, you will have to leap repeatedly to assure that the
Donut Blocks do not fall away on Mario.  Hit the ? Block for a Power-Up as
you pass the halfway point, running past the first two Whomps, pausing to 
let the third Whomp fall down, using it as a stepping stone to reach the
pole to climb upwards.  Hop along the Donut Blocks ahead, reaching a rope to
grab onto, swinging back and forth before leaping to the left.  Run along
the ceiling while going left, falling through the second Star Coin, landing 
on the Whomp, followed by going right to get to the swinging rope once more.

Swing back and forth to draw the Whomp into flopping onto the ground, 
letting Mario leap past, running to the right to leap across a pile driver 
water gap to find a ? Block with a Power-Up inside.  Next is a series of 
Piledrivers to run under/over and to leap, so go at a pace you feel
comfortable with, eventually clearing the nasty area to spot the large 
doors.  However, before heading through this portal, go right, using the
Sldie Duck technique to get under the wall, swimming in place on the left,
waiting for the pile driver to descend and then climb again, signaling Mario
to jump up the ledge to reach the final Star Coin!  Drop back down and swim
under the ledge there to leap up, entering the large doors.

Go to the right to find a bridge set up with fish below it, including the 
boss, Cheepskipper!  To defeat this foe, leap onto his head as he jumps up
above the bridge, getting him three times to beat him.  Just note that Mario
also has to contend with the leaping Cheep-Cheeps while doing this, and that
Fireballs can defeat the foe in 9 hits.  Not a tough boss, just leap 
carefully to defeat it, ending the tour of World Three!
