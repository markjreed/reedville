                               o-----------o
                               | Level 1-1 |
                               o-----------o

Here we go!  Starting with a classic set-up, run forward and bust the 
Goomba before raiding the ? Blocks for Coins and a Power-Up.  Head right,
hitting Bricks for Coins (including a Coin Block up high), followed by a
couple Goombas positioned around a pipe.  Hop the gap ahead to hit the next
? Block for a Mega Mushroom (I advise doing this for the great fun that 
comes from trashing enemies, bricks, pipes... basically anything that is in
Mario's rampaging path), but the walkthrough will continue onwards as if you
never grabbed this Item.

Head right past a Goomba and over a gap, jumping off the pipe to get the 
first Star Coin in the game, followed by hitting the open space between the
bricks ahead to make a ledge to hit the next ledge of bricks to find a
beanstalk (go up for Coins, but note it bypasses a Star Coin if taken).  Go
down the next pipe, jumping over the gaps in the way, killing Goombas to get
a Power-Up from the ? Blocks, finally getting the second Star Coin before 
heading back topside.  Head left from the pipe to go get some Goombas to 
reach the third Star Coin, which is protected by bricks, so use a Ground 
Pound to bust it out, finishing the set for this level!

Now head right, hopping the gaps and pipes, passing a Green Koopa Troopa and
a Red Koopa Troopa, reaching the staircase that is oh so familiar to Super
Mario Brothers veterans.  Climb upwards, taking a running leap to hit the
flagpole to end the level!


                               o-----------o
                               | Level 1-2 |
                               o-----------o

This level begins with a dizzying descent, destroying the bricks for the 
Coins that they protected... provided you are not Regular Mario of course.
Move along to the right, grabbing the Power-Up from the first ? Block and
breaking bricks for the Coins they shelter (note that the dual brick layer
leads down to a bunch of Coins and a Coin Block), followed by leaping to the
right via the brick ledges to snag the first Star Coin.

Go down and right for another Power-Up, dealing with the Goombas and Green
Koopa Troopas, arriving at a brick structure that holds the second Star 
Coin.  To get inside, get directly above the Star Coin's position and 
perform a Ground Pound to bash your way inside, followed by getting out to
move right once more, facing a teeter-totter log ride to the bricks ahead 
(the highest brick is a Coin Block).  Next are three pipes (the first can be
accessed to go into a Bonus Room), two of which house Piranha Plants, so 
shoot them with Fire or just pass by when they retreat into their homes, 
being sure to get the Power-Up in the ? Block while dealing with the 
nuisances.

Hop across the gap ahead (or take a running leap and land on the bricks 
above to run across the top of the area without worry), finding a Green 
Koopa Troopa and two Goombas guarding the way forward to another 
teeter-totter log.  Now the level will split in two, so the Main Route and
the Alternate Route will be outlined:

                                ==========
                                Main Route
                                ==========

Use the teeter-totter log to reach the bricks or ledge ahead, jumping the 
Green Koopa Troopa before hopping the next gap to reach the pipe out of the
subterranean area.  Once outside, climb the staircase and leap to the 
flagpole, ending the level!

                             ===============
                             Alternate Route
                             ===============

Use the teeter-totter log to get high on the right side, leaping onto the 
ceiling, running along it to find the third Star Coin for the level, 
followed by going up through the pipe to use the semi-staircase ahead to 
leap onto the flagpole, ending the level!


                               o-----------o
                               | Level 1-3 |
                               o-----------o

Another classic area from the original Super Mario Brothers, the toadstool
platforms!  Head right to get a Power-Up from a ? Block, followed by using
the springboard ahead to find a second springboard and some Coins, so launch
higher up to bounce off the rubbery toadstool, flying into the first Star
Coin.  Immediately float to the right, following the line of Coins, falling
down to a ledge that holds the second Star Coin!

Grab the Power-Up from the ? Block before passing the halfway point, facing
a red Koopa Troopa, followed by a dual set of rocking toadstools, high above
these two would be the the third Star Coin (jump when they are high in the 
air to finish getting this easy trio of Star Coins).  Head right (jump onto
the high toadstools if possible), finding a Red Coin Ring to go through,
making 8 Red Coins appear, rewarding Mario with a Power-Up if he is Super
Mario or less in his stature or reserve Power-Up, or if he has at least a
Fire Flower in both spots, he will get a 1-Up Mushroom.  All that remains 
from here is to go right and use the remaining rocking toadstool to leap 
onto the Flagpole, ending the level!


                             o---------------o
                             | Level 1-Tower |
                             o---------------o

This level is vertical in nature, with mving walls, so be sure to not get
crushed in between the granite.  Jump up past the Dry Bones to get the 
Power-Up from the ? Block on the left, followed by leaping through the 
various sets of moving granite blocks when they are open, reaching a spot
where two horizontal sprints must be performed to pass through the 
vertically moving blocks.  Head up to the next ledge to get the Power-Up 
that the Dry Bones is guarding, also going further right to get the first
Star Coin before heading left to climb upwards once more.

Jump up the moving granite staircase to head left, performing a set of
wall-jumps to reach a ledge with a door heading inside.  Here is where the 
level splits in two for purposes of the Main Route and the Alternate Route:

                                ==========
                                Main Route
                                ==========

Grab the second Star Coin from the right side of the room, followed by 
exiting out the door, leaping up to the ledge above (between the granite
and the spike blocks), climbing the granite blocks to reach the third Star 
Coin for the level.  Continue jumping up through the next set of granite 
blocks, timing the leaps to not get crushed and reach the ledge above, where
Mario will find a green pipe to use to launch into the air.  Time his entry
into the pipe for as soon as the lowest granite blocks above start to move 
apart, which will safely send Mario up to the high area, where he will see 
the two MASSIVE Dry Bones that were working the moving the granite blocks 
through out the Tower.  Grab the Power-Up from the right before heading 
through the large door.

Baby Bowser will attack Mario simply by running back and forth, attempting 
to ram him at full speed.  The way to defeat the monster is to hit him with
three leaps to the head, though he will retreast to his shell after every
bonk from Mario, so step away until he comes back from his hiding game.  The
other method for defeating Baby Bowser is to hit him with 9 Fireballs, 
though the Fireballs can be combined with the jump attacks to beat Baby 
Bowser as well.  COnsider the Jump attacks remove 3 Hit Points and the 
Fireballs remove 1 Hit Point, meaning that to beat Baby Bowser, 9 Hit Points
must be removed.  Defeat him to end the level, advancing further in the 
quest to save Princess Peach.

                             ===============
                             Alternate Route
                             ===============

For this exit to be accessible, Mario will need to have to be Shell Mario.  
Jump to the right in this room, getting by the door, but instead of heading
through, instead leap up to the hole above, passing through to a secret 
area.  Here Mario will need to use his Shell to bust down the bricks, 
followed by using a leap to busy the bricks above, opening the way to the
pipe that was covered.  After going through the pipe and falling down to
the ground below, you can just leap onto the flagpole, or you can try to
use the Shell run to leap off the bricks above to reach the top of the 
flagpole for a good score.  Either way, this will allow Mario to access the
Warp Cannon on the World Map, sending him all the way to World Five!


                               o-----------o
                               | Level 1-4 |
                               o-----------o

Slide down the hill and kill the Goombas, followed by botting the Green 
Koopa Troopa off the next hill to hit the ? Block to make the Power-Up 
inside come out.  Next up are two Goombas on a slope, leading to an area 
with a Green paratroopa Koopa to dust off, followed by checking the ? Blocks
to find a Mini Mushroom.  The Mini Mushroom will make Mario so tiny that he
can slip through the hole on the left side of the area, going down the tiny 
pipe!  Inside here Mario should run right across the water, wall jumping to
the high ledge to get the Star Coin that resides up there.  

Now head back up the pipe and move to the right, passing a Goomba spewing
pipe to leap a gap, locating a Power-Up in the ? Block row.  Now that Mario
has become Super Mario, go stand on the brick pictured below and perform a
Ground Pound:

  STAND HERE
       |
 _____ v
|  |  |_ _ _
|__|__|_|_|_|
|  |xxxx   xx
|  |xxxx   xx

Enter the pipe to find some Coins, but leave them alone and go right, 
busting the bricks to reveal a P-Switch, which will turn the Coins into 
bricks, forming a path for Mario to climb to the left, finding the second
Star Coin on the ceiling area of the room.  Head right afterwards, taking 
the pipe back to the surface.  At this point, Mario will need to go after 
the third Star Coin, so head left, sliding down the hill to move right 
towards the gap to go across it to get the third Star Coin, finishing the 
set for this level!

Head right from the pipe where Mario emerged from the subterranean area,
facing an upward slope where Goombas pour from a pipe, jumping past that to 
get onto said pipe.  From here Mario can make a jumping effort to reach the 
flagpole ahead, so make a good leap to finish off the level!


                               o-----------o
                               | Level 1-5 |
                               o-----------o

This level has long stretches of spongy toadstool, which will keep bouncing
Mario high into the air.  If you desire to get even more air, press the A
Button as Mario is landing, sending him to the highest reaches of the screen
in the process.  After snagging the Power-Up from the ? Blocks near the 
start, jump when landing on the spongy toadstool, firing Mario high enough 
into the air to get the first Star Coin.  Next up is a bouncy trip to the 
right, finding a Red Koopa Troopa to knock senseless, followed by booting it
to the right so Mario can follow it, watching it clear out a bevy of Koopa 
Troopas, rewarding him with a 1-Up if he stays with the deadly projectile 
long enough!

Bound past the next Red Koopa Troopa, reaching a solid toadstool area, 
followed by a pulley elevator, so get on the one side to raise the other 
(your side will fall) leaping across to the high side to get to the second
Star Coin.  Just a quick note that yes the old stay on the elevator long 
enough and the bars will fall of trick still works, just like in the 
original SMB!  Continue to the right, using the same trick on the third
pulley elevator, getting on the right side of it when it is high to enter 
the pipe that resides above it.  Here Mario will ride a rocking toadstool,
grabbing Coins and the third Star Coin, followed by hopping down the hole
at the end to return to the main area of the level.

As Mario passes the halfway point (and two Green Paratroopa Koopas), he
will find more of the spongy toadstool and a Power-Up nestled in the nearby
? Blocks, leading into a Red Coin Ring (bounce around the few spongy 
toadstools and the Goomba to get the reward).  Continue along carefully, 
beating up any enemies to find four Coin Blocks to raid, with the results
coming from bouncing into them from below, getting Mario stopped underneath
them perfectly, allowing the spongy toadstool to do all the work for Mario. 
After this are a couple Goombas laced into the spongy toadstool hopping, 
finishing with bouncing high to the right to hit the flagpole, ending the
level!


                               o-----------o
                               | Level 1-A |
                               o-----------o

Head down the pipe to find a Power-Up in the ? Block, which will also be the
point where the level begins to scroll, meaning that couple classic Mario 
game rules are in effect: Mario can get squished by the solid obstacles in 
his path if he gets stuck on the left side of the screen, and the enemies
will be positioned in such a manner that Mario will need to run through the
gauntlet with precision strokes.  With the scrolling fo the screen will come
a vaguely familiar enemy in Sushi, a blue shark from Super Mario 64 that 
often will enter the screen with a fellow Sushi, charging straight ahead.  
So Mario is advised to steer clear of them or to let some fireballs take 
care of the problem, if he has the capability.

Head right through the multitudes of Sushis in this area, finding a P-Switch
to hit to reveal silver Coins spread among the bouncy obstacles ahead, so 
swim precisely to get through the area quickly, grabbing all the Coins along
the way.  After this area send Mario swimming for the ceiling of the next 
stretch, as a Star Coin rests up here, and it is difficult to come at it 
from below due to the invisible blocks that populate the area.  From there
Mario will go right, entering the pipe leading upwards, appearing near the
second Star Coin.

Upon entering the water area again, avoid the Cheep-Cheeps and hit the 
rotating Power-Ups for the picture that is on the block when Mario makes
contact from below.  Next up are Sushis attacking from the left, so dodge 
them and enter the Red Coin Ring to go try for the Power-Up/1-Up reward.  
The Sushis will now switch back to attacking from the right, but they are 
aided by air currents from pipes, so swim through the currents between waves
of Sushis, finding a P-Switch to hit, revealing a multitude of silver Coins
to grab, all the while dodging Sushi charges.

Swim right as soon as the Star Coin appears above, grabbing the Star Coin,
followed by either ducking to avoid the incoming Sushi or swim back out 
quickly.  Swim past the last few Sushis and head up the pipe, going forward
to jump to the flagpole to end the level!


                             o----------------o
                             | Level 1-Castle |
                             o----------------o

Head right, suing the rope platforms to cross lava fields and to launch
Mario high into the air.  After getting the ? Block Power-Up, go past a few
Podoboos in the lava, finding a Dry Bones guarding a set of moving spike
blocks.  Run underneath the spikes, stopping in the various openings 
(grabbing the Coins and such that are in the openings), arriving at an 
opening where the Star Coin above beckons.  Wait for the spike blocks to
descend, using a wall jump to reach the Star Coin.

Head right to pass the halfway point, grabbing the Power-Up en route to some
more rope and Podoboo action, leading to a Dry Bones guarding a jump to a 
small ledge which holds the second Star Coin.  Head right to find another
rope rigging bridge, but only go right to get past the last Podoboo here, 
followed by letting Mario sink on the rop for a second before jumping, 
launching him up to the pipe just off the screen above, entering it to 
locate the third Star Coin.  Head back out to go right past a Dry Bones, 
leaping across the rising and falling granite blocks to leap one final lava
gap to enter the large doors ahead.

Baby Bowser will send in Bowser to fight against Mario... on a breakaway
bridge.  Yes, Baby Bowser has never read a history book apparently on the
entire game of Super Mario Brothers.  Anyway, Bobwer can be taken down 
through three particular strategies:

  i) The easiest way to beat him is to get onto the elevator floating on the 
     bridge, waiting for Bowser to draw near so Mario can take a running
     leap past the beast to hit the switch and drop Bowser into the lava.

 ii) Fireballs can roast the beast, taking him out in a few short bursts.
     Although this manner will drop Bowser into the lava below, only hitting
     the switch will end the battle.

iii) This is an unorthodox option, but as Shell Mario you can bash Bowser 
     until he falls into the lava defeated.  The same rules apply for 
     hitting the switch to end the level.
