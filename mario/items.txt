                            o----------------o


Name......: Blue Shell.
Power.....: This former housing of a Koopa Troopa will allow Mario to don 
            the status symbol of the Koopa Klan.
How To Use: Holding DOWN to duck in place, staying protected from attacks,
            but the main use is spinning wildly forward after dashing for a
            short while, breaking bricks and killing enemies.


Name......: Fire Flower.
Power.....: This little petunia will allow Mario to become Fiery Mario so 
            he can throw fireballs at his foes.
How To Use: Press the X/Y Button to throw a Fireball, with a maximum of two
            Fireballs allowed on screen at a time.


Name......: Mega Mushroom.
Power.....: This massive Mushroom will turn Mario into a behemoth of an 
            individual, making him as tall as 2/3 of the screen!
How To Use: Simply run forward, plowing through enemies, bricks, pipes...
            anything that normally would be a problem for Mario will now
            get destroyed.  After the short rampage ends, some 1-Ups will
            be awarded based on the damage dished out.


Name......: Mini Mushroom.
Power.....: This miniscule Mushroom will shrink Mario down to a size that 
            even Regular Mario can laugh at.  Any hit will do him in, so be
            careful.
How To Use: While in this form Mario gains a higher leap, more hang time and
            air acrobatic control, and the ability to run across the surface 
            of water.


Name......: Invincible Starman.
Power.....: When collected, this Star will make Mario flash wildly (his 
            colour you perverted person!) and make him invulnerable to 
            enemies (although he can still die through a few ways).
How To Use: Simply collect and plow through enemies without fear!


Name......: Super Mushroom.
Power.....: Mario will change from Regular Mario into Super Mario, which 
            will allow Mario to take a hit instead of dying.  This is also 
            required for Mario to be eligible for Fire Flowers.
How To Use: Just collect it to gain the power.
