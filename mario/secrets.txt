9) This section will examine some of the many secrets and tricks found 
   within the game.  I accept contributions, so feel free to send any in and
   I will add them as I see fit, giving credit to those who contribute.


                           o--------------------o
                           | Stars On Your File |
                           o--------------------o

As you progress in the game, you will get Stars that are awarded to you for
achieving certain feats.  These goals are:

  i) Save Princess Peach.
 ii) Defeat every level in the game, including the Alternate Exits (read 
     below for information on which levels have them).
iii) Spend every single Star Coin.


                         o-----------------------o
                         | Alternate Exit Levels |
                         o-----------------------o

The following levels have Alternate Exits, so look in the walkthrough under 
the "Alternate Route" heading to find out how to reach these areas.

                           | World 4 & World 7 |
                           o-------------------o

When fighting the boss of World 2 and World 5, if done as Mini Mario it will
allow Mario to go through the narrow opening in the next room of the castle
to end up in the lower Worlds on the map screen.  These are not "small" 
worlds, as you are not forced to be Mini Mario for the entire World, they
play just like regular Worlds.


                             o----------------o
                             | Flagpole Rules |
                             o----------------o

The flagpole is how each regular level is finished, with Mario trying to land
on it to gain points based on how high up the Flagpole he manages to reach.

_____________|___|

If Mario manages to land around the ball on top of the Flagpole or higher,
he will actually get a 1-Up for his efforts.  You are not able to jump clear
over the Flagpole, so do not waste your time trying, as you will just fall 
down to grab the Flagpole and get that aforementioned 1-Up!

However, the Flagpole also holds some additional surprises, which are based
around the time remaining on the clock when Mario touches said Flagpole.  
The little touches and odes to the past are what make this a great game, so
it makes sense that every now and then you will get the classic level 
clearing music from the original Super Mario Brothers.  To achieve this feat
and to get some classic fireworks as well (worth 4000 points a pop), you 
will need to have the following time left on the clock (note the times are
listed without the hundreds column, as they are not required for this 
trick):

X11 = 1 Firework
X22 = 2 Fireworks
X33 = 3 Fireworks
X44 = 4 Fireworks

Now, while this is pretty coo, the multiples of 11 for the timer will also
play into making an extra Mushroom House appear on the overworld, which will
be deposited on the first spot in each world (just to the left of the first
level).  The following times will yield the following Mushroom House type:

X11 = Item Toad House
X22 = Item Toad House
X33 = Item Toad House
X44 = Green Toad House
X55 = Green Toad House
X66 = Green Toad House
X77 = Mega Toad House
X88 = Mega Toad House
X99 = Mega Toad House

Note that only one Toad House may be on that spot at one time, so go enter 
and get the prize from inside, allowing you to create another one in that 
spot.  This is a good way to get an Item you need for a level (say you need
to be Mini Mario or Shell Mario... it makes getting the Item fairly easy).


                           o-------------------o
                           | Luigi Adventuring |
                           o-------------------o

Despite being treated as nothing better than a joke in most Mario games (in
particular the Mario RPG's), some people still love the slimmer, younger 
version of the Mario Brothers.  To play as Luigi, simply hold down the 
L Button and the R Button while selecting the game file you wish to use.
Note that he plays no differently than Mario, but we all know Luigi is the 
cooler of the two Mario Brothers!



                        o------------------------o
                        | Item Toad House Fixing |
                        o------------------------o

You want to be able to get that specific Item when you need it the most?  
The following method will help make the results end in the manner that you
seek.

First off, the order of the Items in the large box are as follows, repeating
endlessly:

Super Mushroom -> Fire Flower -> Blue Shell -> Mini Mushroom

Now, if you wish to get a specific Item, simply go in and get under the box,
followed by repeatedly pausing and unpausing the game.  Watch the Item box
carefully to see which Item showed up last, watching for the Item that is
TWO positions to the left of your desired item.  This means that if you seek
an item, use the following chart:

                      _______________ ______________
                     | Pictured Item | Desired Item |
                     |_______________|______________|
                     |Super Mushroom |  Blue Shell  |
                     |_______________|______________|
                     |  Fire Flower  |Mini Mushroom |
                     |_______________|______________|
                     |  Blue Shell   |Super Mushroom|
                     |_______________|______________|
                     | Mini Mushroom | Fire Flower  |
                     |_______________|______________|

Although it is not 100% foolproof, it is highly accurate, making it an ideal
way to get that much needed or wanted Item.
