8) This section will look at the Mario vs. Luigi multiplayer and at the 
   various single player distractions found within the game.


                            o-----------------o
                            | Mario vs. Luigi |
                            o-----------------o

After connecting to your opponent (in this game, you only need the one game
cart to play this mode), the game will set out options for the rules of the
game:

  i) Set the number of wins.
 ii) Set the number of Big Stars to collect for a victory.
iii) Set the number of lives for the match for Mario and Luigi (includes
     endless setting).
 iv) Set the time for each course, though it also has a random feature.


Once the game starts, the goal is to collect enough Big Stars to defeat your
opponent, though they can also be stolen from your rival if they have any
by attacking them with leaps, hitting from underneath, or with Power-Ups.

Coins can be collected in this mode, with every 8 snagged causing an Item to
appear for collection.

Although the point is to go right after those Big Stars, sometimes it is 
best to let your opponent do the dirty work of collecting, ambushing them
as soon as they get it to relieve them of what is rightfully yours.

                                o--------o

                              ===============
                              Snowball Slalom
                              ===============

Objective: Get the Snowball across the finish line before time runs out.
Strategy.: Simply put, you will have to repeatedly move the stylus from 
           bottom to top on the Touch Screen, building up speed.  Also, you
           will need to do miniscule left and right corrections on the Touch
           Screen, avoiding the rocks and penguins that litter the path.
           Work on getting a very smooth stroke with the stylus, having 
           little time wasted with the stylus off the Touch Screen.


                               =============
                               Lakitu Launch
                               =============

Objective: Get as many Spinies into the Lakitu held shells as possible.
Strategy.: Pull down on the Touch Screen to pull the slingshot taut, 
           followed by releasing to launch.  You will need to aim the 
           trajectory of the shot by moving left and right on the Touch 
           Screen while pilling back for power.  After firing a shot, glance
           at the top screen to see where the Lakitus are moving to, at
           which point you should start the aim and pull back on the Touch
           Screen.  It takes about a second to reload the slingshot, so 
           practice on getting a smooth rhythm down for a constant rate of
           fire.


                         =========================
                         Danger, Bob-Omb!  Danger!
                         =========================

Objective: Help the Bob-Omb avoid having his fuse lit by Bowser and the
           fireballs.
Strategy.: For this game, the stylus should ALWAYS stay in contact with the
           Touch Screen.  Move the Bob-Omb around the screen, avoiding the
           incoming fireballs, but do keep an eye out for Bowser's flame, as
           he may try to cut your area off with a long blast of flame.


                               =============
                               Whack-A-Monty
                               =============

Objective: Hit as many Monty Moles as possible, but do not hit Luigi.
Strategy.: Simply put, always have your stylus moving, touching the Monty
           Moles while avoiding the Luigis.  Perhaps the easiest way to do
           this is to simply train your brain to look for brown as targets 
           and to avoid green, as that is faster than making a full identity
           check on your targets.


                              ==============
                              Balloon Racing
                              ==============

Objective: using your breath, lift Yoshi past the Shy Guys to reach the goal
           before time runs out.
Strategy.: This game will be a very frustrating one, as it is extremely
           tough to use your breath to give Yoshi the proper momentum to get
           past charging Shy Guys and to hold up and wait for the Shy Guys 
           to clear a path above.  Carefully move Yoshi upwards, reaching 
           the goal, but sometimes taking a hit may work in your favour, as
           he can get by the Shy Guy quicker than waiting for the foe to
           move.


                                o--------o
                                | Puzzle |
                                o--------o

                                  =======
                                  Wanted!
                                  =======

Objective: Pick out the character from the Wanted poster on the top screen 
           and touch him.
Strategy.: Although the game starts out with very little challenge, the 
           screen will quickly become filled up with other Mario characters.
           To further complicate matters, as you progress in level the 
           character faces will begin to move, making it possible to miss 
           them.  For every correct character you get, 5 is added to your 
           time, BUT for every incorrect character you get, a whopping 10
           is removed from your time.


                              ==============
                              Which Wiggler?
                              ==============

Objective: Pick out the Wiggler that matches the one on the top screen.
Strategy.: The best method for identifying the Wiggler early on is to
           pick out two body segments you feel comfortable identifying (I 
           choose the last two on the Wiggler), followed by finding that 
           Wiggler below.  However, as the levels progress, the Wigglers 
           move and the body markings begin to become really hard to 
           identify, so you will need to expand your area of identification 
           to extra segments.  For every correct Wiggler you get, 5 is added
           to your time, BUT for every incorrect Wiggler you get, a 
           whopping 10 is removed from your time.


                             =================
                             Hide And Boo Seek
                             =================

Objective: Locate and touch the Boos in their hiding places to reveal them.
           Find them all before time runs out.
Strategy.: Watch where the Boos are moving on screen before the lights go
           out, and begin to run the screen where they are.  When the lights
           do go out, this will reveal the hiding Boos.  However, as their 
           numbers increase, begin like this, but quickly switch over to a
           quick search stroke, finding specific Boos in the process to stop
           on momentarily to reveal completely.


                               ============
                               Puzzle Panel
                               ============

Objective: Match the bottom screen to the top screen by touching the panels
           to flip them over, performing the deed in the turns allotted.
Strategy.: Remember that for whatever panel you touch, it and each panel 
           that touches it will flip over, which includes the four diagonal
           panels.  Look carefully before touching the screen, remembering
           that panels that are on the border of the design will not have as
           many panel flips occur, making them strategically valuable in
           most puzzles.


                              ==============
                              Coincentration
                              ==============

Objective: Watch the falling Coins and choose the block that holds them, but
           choose wrong and the game will end.
Strategy.: Although it is tough to, try to choose two rows to watch, getting
           a fairly good idea of where the Coins are.  Although it leaves 
           one row fairly unscouted, it will make for a fairly high score.


                                o-------o
                                | Table |
                                o-------o

                               ============
                               Memory Match
                               ============

Objective: Match up all the cards before making three mistakes.
Strategy.: This is a game of chance, but by using a system it will lessen
           your chances of failure.  Start out by choosing two cards beside 
           one another (just as likely to match as any two other choices),
           remembering what each card is (I like to use a single letter for
           easy identification instead of a full name), followed by checking
           a different card on the next turn.  If it matches one of the
           cards flipped previously, then match it up, but if it is 
           different than the previous two, pick the card beside it (again
           memorize where they are if they are not a match).  By using this
           fairly simple system, you will be able to advance through 
           multiple rounds with ease.


                               =============
                               Picture Poker
                               =============

Objective: Beat Luigi's hand to win some Coins.
Strategy.: Card values are as follows...
           Cloud -> Mushroom -> Fire Flower -> Luigi -> Mario -> Starman

           Hand Hierarchy is as follows, with the multiplier for winning in
           brackets...

           Junk -> One Pair (2) -> Two Pair (3) -> Three of a Kind (4) -> 
           Full House (6) -> Four of a Kind (8) -> Five of a Kind (16)

           Whenever it appears that you will have a high Two Pair or better,
           increase the bet to the maximum amount of five Coins, as you are
           fairly likely to win.  When picking which cards to throw away,
           it is rare you want to hold a card that has no match, with the 
           sole exception being when you have Junk (ie five different 
           cards).


                                ===========
                                Pair-A-Gone
                                ===========

Objective: Match up all the cards in a line (vertical/horizontal/diagonal)
           to clear them away.
Strategy.: Match up two of the same card to begin clearing the table, trying
           to avoid getting some cards split up near the end.  As the number
           of cards on the table lessens, you will really need to consider 
           what each pair cleared will do to the card position.


                                o---------o
                                | Variety |
                                o---------o

                               ==============
                               Mario's Slides
                               ==============

Objective: Guide Mario to the star five times by drawing new slides for him
           to ride, but lead him to a Piranha Plant and the game ends.
Strategy.: Always draw your lines high up on the bottom screen, as that will
           leave more recovery room for later on in the level when you have
           to account for the extra lines that you have created earlier.  
           This also applies for when Mario speeds up, as it will leave a 
           bit of a safety net for you as well.


                              ===============
                              Sort Or 'Splode
                              ===============

Objective: Sort the red and black Bob-Ombs into their respective areas, as
           putting one into the wrong pen will end the game.
Strategy.: To start it is very easy to sort them, so get them into their 
           pens quickly, as the numbers and speed at which they appear begin
           to increase.  if you take too long to get Bob-Ombs into their pen
           the colour of the one that exploded will cause their respective
           coloured Bob-Ombs to be counted up, allowing the game to continue.
           Note that once a pen reaches it maximum capacity (ie 40 Bob-Ombs)
           that the game will add them up before allowing you to try for more
           of that type.


                            ==================
                            Bounce And Trounce
                            ==================

Objective: Three Marios will need to be kept aloft by touching them to send
           them leaping into the air, trying to stomp the Shy Guys.  Miss 
           three times and the game ends.
Strategy.: Simply put, keep the three Marios in the air.  At first it is
           easy enough to try and aim the three Marios at the Shy Guys, but 
           as the sky becomes thick with the red coated fellows, it becomes
           a game of survival, making sure that Mario can get past the swarm
           above.


                               =============
                               Bob-Omb Squad
                               =============

Objective: Shoot the Bob-Ombs out of the sky so they can not hit your 
           flowers in the garden, as losing all four flowers will lose the
           game.
Strategy.: Launch shots constantly, trying to line up each new shot mentally
           while tracking the previous shot to see if it hit the intended
           target.  As the sky thickens with attackers, try to hit multiple 
           Bob-Ombs with one shot, and take careful aim to hit Lakitu as he
           moves back and forth across the screen (if he is one corner, get
           aimed for the other corner and nail him when he moves there).  
           When the Bob-Ombs get onto the bottom screen, still aim upwards,
           but pull the shot down lower than the incoming Bob-Omb, 
           destroying it as soon as it is launched.


                              ===============
                              Trampoline Time
                              ===============

Objective: Get the three Marios into the open door by drawing in trampolines
           to bounce them in there, but three misses will end the game.
Strategy.: Much like the Bounce and Trounce, the primary goal is not to aim
           Mario to the doors, but rather to keep all three in the air.  If
           they are kept moving, then eventually they will make it to the 
           door.  Just be careful to not seal a Mario below other 
           Trampolines, as you will have to keep him afloat with more and
           more drawings, likely ignoring the other Marios, which ends up
           badly (usually anyway).
