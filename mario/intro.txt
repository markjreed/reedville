I dedicate this FAQ to the character who saved gaming... Mario!  Mario 
continues to entertain me, even after all these years, and this game is no
different, combining the old school with the newer elements of the Italian
plumber from Brooklyn.  I salute you Mario!

Also, for Cougar, Howler, and Koonce.  I miss you, and I hope you are living
it up in the afterlife as you did in this world.  You will always be in my 
memories, and you will never be forgotten.

1) The following is directly from the New Super Mario Brothers instruction
   manual, and is in no way the work of Brian P. Sulpher:


EMERGENCY NEWS FLASH!


Princess Peach has been kidnapped! While enjoying a nice walk with Mario, 
the beloved ruler of the Mushroom Kingdom was whisked away by an unknown 
assailant. How could this happen with Mario around?


According to eyewitnesses, the walk was going swimmingly when Mario and the 
princess spotted smoke billowing out of Peach's Castle. The mustachioed 
marvel immediately jumped into action and sped off toward the fire. The 
moment he left her side, the princess vanished!


Who's behind Princess Peach's disappearance?


Who's behind the attack on Peach's Castle?


Are the two incidents related?


Didn't Bowser Jr. once think Princess Peach might be his mother?


Looks like Mario's going to need all the Mega Mushrooms he can find to get 
to the bottom of this mess!


   Well, not exactly Shakespeare I admit, but then again, when have Mario 
   and Luigi's adventures ever been about the story anyway?  The reason I
   mention their previous adventures is that as a long time platformer, I
   have experienced all the Mario games in this genre, so I warn you now I 
   will occasionally comment on certain areas, situations, and set-ups as 
   they are either tributes or exact matches to areas found within anything 
   from the original SMB through to Super Mario World to Super Mario 64 to
   Super Mario Sunshine!  Hopefully younger gamers will learn some things, 
   while you older gamers get a kick out of the details that Nintendo 
   decided to put in for us fans!  Enjoy my FAQ for the New Super Mario 
   Brothers!

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

2) This section will outline the control for Mario, both basic and advanced.


                            o----------------o
                            | Basic Controls |
                            o----------------o

D-Pad...: UP and DOWN will move Mario into pipes, though holding DOWN will
          also allow Mario to duck.  LEFT and RIGHT will move him in the 
          corresponding direction pressed.

START...: Pauses/unpauses the game, bringing up the in-game menu.

A Button: Press to make Mario jump. Also doubles as a swimming stroke in the
          water.

B Button: Press to make Mario jump. Also doubles as a swimming stroke in the
          water.

X Button: Hold this button to dash and to pick up Shells/springboards/etc.
          Also allows Mario to punch doors on the fences to get to the other
          side.

Y Button: Hold this button to dash and to pick up Shells/springboards/etc.
          Also allows Mario to punch doors on the fences to get to the other
          side.

L Button: Scroll the map screen to the left.

R Button: Scroll the map screen to the right.


                           o-------------------o
                           | Advanced Controls |
                           o-------------------o

                               =============
                               Anytime Moves
                               =============

Double/Triple Jump: When coming down from a jump (holding the X/Y Button), 
                    immediately press the B/A Button to rocket back into the
                    air, achieving more height and style than the previous 
                    jump.

Gap Dashing.......: When the space between platforms are one space, you can 
                    hold the X/Y Button to pass over the holes without 
                    falling through.

Ground Pound......: When Mario has jumped into the air, press DOWN to slam
                    his weight down, delivering a brutal hit to enemies and
                    bricks, breaking the bricks if he is not Regular Mario.

Slide Duck........: Sometimes the open space is only the size that Regular 
                    Mario could normally pass through, but Mario can run at 
                    the space, duck (press DOWN) just before he gets there, 
                    and then he will slide through to the far side.

Sliding...........: On a hill's slope, press DOWN to slide down the hill and
                    kill enemies that are in the way.

Super Jump........: When you hop on an enemy, hold the A Button to fly 
                    farther into the air than a normal hop would bring 
                    Mario.

Wall Jump.........: When Mario jumps into a wall, press towards the wall, 
                    followed by pressing A/B Button to send him kicking off
                    the wall to gain some height.  When used in a narrow 
                    vertical corridor, he will be able to reach heights he 
                    could not get to through conventional means.


                                ===========
                                Fiery Mario
                                ===========

Firepower: Press the Y/X Button to throw a Fireball that can scorch enemies.
           Maximum of two Fireballs on screen at a time.


                                ===========
                                Shell Mario
                                ===========

Shell Dash: Holding down the X/Y Button will allow Mario to run, building
            enough speed to start spinning around as he slides like any old
            Koopa Troopa.  He will keep going in the same direction till he
            hits an object (reverses course) or releases the X/Y Button.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
---------------------------World Map Information----------------------------
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

3) This section will examine the rules, functions, and structures found 
   within the World map, and what they mean for Mario.


                             o--------------o
                             | World Layout |
                             o--------------o

Each world will have set of levels, objects, Toad Houses, and enemy 
installations strewn about it, usually connected by pathway.  However, some
levels will have two exits, with each exit leading down a different path, 
meaning that Mario will beat the level both ways to open both paths from that
level to the next two stops.  Often the more difficult to find/get to exit
will yield the path to the levels with letters (A or B) instead of the more
conventional paths of numbered levels and Towers/Castles.


                              o------------o
                              | Toad House |
                              o------------o

These are the places on the nap where Mario can improve his chances of 
rescuing Princess Peach.  The following Toad Houses exist:

Green Toad House: With a series of blocks to randomly select, hit them to
                  reveal 1-Ups.  The long you go, the higher the 1-Up totals
                  will be, but the game ends once the Bowser ? Block is hit.
                  Luckily, the 1-Ups found to that point are still yours to 
                  keep.

Item Toad House : The tried and true Toad House, one random Item will be 
                  Mario's after he hits the flashing Item Block, sending it 
                  into the Item reserve for you.

Mega Toad House : No guessing or luck involved here... Mario will hit the
                  giant ? Block (love the SMB3 reference here) to reveal a
                  Mega Mushroom, which will be put into his reserves for 
                  whenever he decides to use it.


                     o-------------------------------o
                     | Winged Blocks/Hammer Brothers |
                     o-------------------------------o

These two will move about the map randomly, stopping in a level.  If Mario
enters the level they are occupying, he will then get a free Item from the
Winged Block if he hits it, or he will have to face a might member of the
Hammer Brother Family.
