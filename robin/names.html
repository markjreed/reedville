<h1>Robin's Elvish Project: <a href="names.jpg">Names</a></h1>

<p>First, you've clearly got the hang of the transliteration. There are a
few minor mistakes, and a couple things to be aware of since we're in the
realm of transliterating English names, but overall you've got it down.</p>

<p>There are two schools of thought as far as representing English with
Tengwar. One, the "orthographic" approach, uses more or less a one-to-one
correspondence between our Latin letters and the Tengwar symbols; the other,
"phonemic" approach, is based on pronunciation.  I'll go over Rick's and your
names as examples, although there's nothing wrong with your rendering except
a left-off vowel on "Robiniel".</p>

<h2>Rick</h2>

<div class="display" id="rick"></div>

<p>This is perfect in the orthographic transliteration.  In the phonemic
transliteration, the <b>ck</b> won't need the geminate marker,
since the final /k/ sound doesn't sound any different than it would if spelled
"Ric" or "Rik". Typeset versions:</p>

<p>Orthographic: <b class="display tengwar">7z:T</b></p>
<p>Phonemic: <b class="display tengwar">7zT</b></p>

<h2>Rickion</h2>

<p>Besides the lack of a geminate marker, there may be another difference here
if you go with the phonemic representation: the final vowel.  Interpreting the
orthographic version phonemically, you get "ricky-awn".  If it's more like
"ricky-ahn" or "ricky-own", then you would use different vowel signs:</p>

<p>Orthographic: <b class="tengwar big">7z:T`G5^</b></p>
<p>Phonemic: <b class="tengwar big">7zT`G5^</b>,
<b class="tengwar big">7zT`G5#</b>,
or
<b class="tengwar big">7zT`G5N^</b>.</p>

<h2>Robin</h2>

<div class="display" id="robin"></div>

<p>Phonemically, the vowel <b class="tengwar big">&#x25cc;^</b> is correct if your
name is pronounced "RAW-bin", but should be <b class="tengwar big">&#x25cc;#</b> if
pronounced "RAH-bin". (For many American English speakers, there's no
difference between "rah" and "raw"; in that case, take your pick. :) )</p>

<p>Orthographic: <b class="tengwar big">7w^5%</b></p>
<p>Phonemic: <b class="tengwar big">7w^5%</b> or 
             <b class="tengwar big">7w#5%</b>.</p>

<h2>Robiniel</h2>
As I said, you seem to be missing the <b>e</b> from <b>Robiniel</b>, but
otherwise that looks right.

<p>Orthographic: <b class="tengwar big">7w^5T`GjR</b></p>
<p>Phonemic: <b class="tengwar big">7w^5T`GjR</b> or 
             <b class="tengwar big">7w#5T`GjR</b>.</p>

<h2>Ophelia</h2>

<div class="display" id="ophelia"></div>

<p>I would maybe drop the <b>-ia</b> when adding <b>-iel</b>, so you get
"Opheliel" instead of "Opheliaiel".  In any case, what you have here
is <b>Opelia</b>. To get "Ophelia" in the orthographic scheme, you need to
insert a tengwa for the <b>h</b>; in the phonemic one, you would use <b>f</b>
instead of the <b>ph</b> combo. Also, assuming it's pronouned "oh-feely-a",
those first two vowels would be long in the phonemic version:</p>

<p>Orthographic: <b class="tengwar big">q^9jR`G`C</b></p>
<p>Phonemic: <b class="tengwar big">~Ne~Gj`G`C</b></p>

<h2>Vana</h2>

<div class="display" id="vana"></div>

<p>The word <i>v&aacute;na</i> is Quenya, not Sindarin, so the vowels go over
the previous consonant instead of the following one. Also, the first <b>a</b> is long:</p>

<p class="display tengwar">r~C5#</p>

<h2>Swift draughts...</h2>

<div class="display" id="swift"></div>

<p>Tolkien personally wrote several versions of <i>Nam&aacute;riÃ«</i> in
Tengwar; if you Google around, you can find them. For example, there's an
analysis of one of them <a
href="http://folk.uib.no/hnohf/namteng.pdf">here</a>.  These should be a good
check when borrowing phrases from that poem.</p>

<p>Here's a snippet that shows the phrases you've borrowed here; the word
<i>lint&euml;</i> starts in the middle of the first line shown:</p>

<img src="namarie.png">

<p>You used the non-Quenya vowel placement, but other than that it looks
different because the Quenya mode of Tengwar has several individual
<i>tengwar</i> that represent consonant clusters, which are used instead of
the individual consonants. For instance, the <b>nt</b>
in <i>lint&euml;</i> is represented by <b class="big tengwar">4</b> instead of the
<i>tengwa</i> for <b>n</b> followed by the <i>tengwa</i> for <b>t</b>.
Similarly, the <b>ld</b> in <i>yuldar</i> is represented by <b
class="big tengwar">m</b>. You can find all of these in the chart <a
href="http://at.mansbjorkman.net/teng_quenya.htm">here</a>; the important
thing is, when you have two consonants together, look to make sure there's
not a single glyph for the cluster before you reach for their individual
letters.</p>

<p>When typeset, <i>lint&euml; yuldar</i> comes out like this:</p>

<p class="display tengwar">jT4F h&Igrave;Jm#6</p>

<p>And <i>liss&euml;-miruv&oacute;reva</i> like this:</p>

<p class="display tengwar">jT,FtT7Jy~N7FyD</p>
