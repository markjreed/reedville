<h2 class="italic">1. S&iacute; man i yulma nin enquantuva?</h2>

<div class="display" id="line1"></div>

<h3 class="italic">S&iacute;</h3>

<div class="display" id="si"></div>

<p>With the syllable <i>si</i>, it may be easier to use <i>silm&euml;
nuquerna</i> ("inverted S") for the <b>s</b>, to more clearly separate the
vowel sign (<i>tehta</i>) from the curl of the consonant:</p>

<p class="display tengwar">iG</p>

<p>There's no difference in meaning between the two symbols; it's purely an
aesthetic choice. (Note that the tail of the inverted version descends below
the line of writing.)</p>

<p>The first syllable in your sentence is, however, not <i>si</i>, but
<i>s&iacute;</i>.  The accent over the <b>i</b> in the transliteration
indicates that the vowel is long, which changes the rendering in Tengwar.</p>

<p>Long vowels are normally indicated by using the "long carrier", which
follows the consonant <i>tengwa</i> and "carries" the vowel (because you put
the vowel over it instead of the consonant). That means there's no need to
invert the <i>silm&euml;</i> just to keep it from running into the vowel, since
the vowel is over the long carrier instead, so you're back to pure aesthetics
there.</p>

<p>The second version below the transliteration has the right idea, but appears
to be using the short carrier instead of the long carrier; like the inverted
<i>silm&euml;</i>, the long carrier has a tail that descends below the line of
writing.  So, depending on the version of <i>silm&euml;</i>, <i>s&iacute;</i>
looks like either this:</p>

<p class="display tengwar">8~G</p>

<p>or this:</p>

<p class="display tengwar">i~G</p>

<p>For some long vowels you have the option of doubling the <i>tehta</i>
instead of using the long carrier, but that doesn't work for <b>i</b> since the
double-dot is a separate vowel altogether (though one not used in Quenya).</p>

<h3 class="italic">man</h3>

<div class="display" id="man"></div>

<p>The Tengwar above appears to be in English or Sindarin mode, because the
<b>a</b> is over the <b>n</b> instead of over the <b>m</b>.  In Quenya mode, it
should look like this instead:</p>

<div class="display tengwar">t#5</div>

<h3 class="italic">i</h3>

<p>When a word starts with (or consists entirely of) a short vowel like
<b>i</b>, you put the vowel sign over the "short carrier" <b
class="tengwar">`</b>.  So the <b>i</b> should look not unlike its Latin
transliteration:</p>

<div class="display tengwar">`G</div>

<h3 class="italic">yulma</h3>

<div class="display" id="yulma"></div>

<p>Syllables with an initial <b>y</b> are an unusual case.  There is no plain
<i>tengwa</i> glyph representing consonantal <b>y</b>, so we use <b
class="tengwar">h</b>, which originally represented the "zh" sound (as in the
middle of English "measure") before Quenya lost that sound, plus the
palatalization <i>tehta</i> <b class="tengwar">&#x25cc;&Iacute;</b>, which
normally represents the insertion of a "y"-sound between another consonant and
the main vowel of the syllable.  Put together with the vowel <b
class="tengwar">&#x25cc;J</b> for <b>u</b> and <b class="tengwar">j</b> for the
trailing <b>l</b>, you get <b class="tengwar">h&Iacute;Jj</b> for the syllable
<i>yul-</i>, and this for the whole word <i>yulma</i>:</p>

<div class="display tengwar">h&Iacute;Jjt#</div>

<h3 class="italic">nin</h3>

<div class="display" id="nin"></div>

<p>This looks like English/Sindarin mode again.  Should be this:</p>

<div class="display tengwar">5G5</div>

<h3 class="italic">enquantuva</h3>

<div class="display" id="enquantuva"></div>

<p>Well, those are wildly-different renderings.  Let's break it down by
syllables.</p>

<h4>en-</h4>

<p>Here we have another word starting with a short vowel, so we again use the short
carrier. By itself, an initial <b>e</b> looks like <b class="tengwar">`F</b>, making
the whole initial syllable <b>en-</b> look like this:</p>

<div class="display tengwar">`F5</div>

<h4>-quan-</h4>

<p>It's worth mentioning here that the sound spelled (and pronounced) <b>qu</b>
is a single phoneme in Quenya; it used to be spelled just <b>q</b> without the
<b>u</b>, but Tolkien wanted it to look more Latinish. In Tengwar, though, it's
still a single <i>tengwa</i> <b class="tengwar">z</b> - there is no vowel
<i>tehta</i> corresponding to the <b>u</b>.  So <b>-quan-</b> looks like this:</p>

<div class="display tengwar">z#5</div>

<h4>-tu- and -va</h4>
<p>The last two syllables are relatively straightforward - just the initial
consonant with the vowel above it. <b>-tu-</b> is <b class="tengwar">qJ</b>,
while <b>-va</b> is <b class="tengwar">y#</b>.  </p>

<p>Putting it all together, the word <b>enquantuva</b> should look like
this:</p>

<div class="display tengwar">`F5z#5qJy#</div>

<h3 class="italic">S&iacute; man i yulma nin enquantuva?</h3>

<p>With the addition of the Tengwar equvialent of a question mark, we now
have enough to transliterate the entire question:</p>

<div class="display tengwar">8~G t#5 `G h&Iacute;Jjt# 5G5 `F5z#5qJy# &#192;</div>

<p>Or, with the <i>silm&euml; nuquerna</i>:</p>

<div class="display tengwar">i~G t#5 `G h&Iacute;Jjt# 5G5 `F5z#5qJy# &#192;</div>

<p>Also, while Tengwar normally uses word-spacing much as we do, inscriptions
sometimes use center dots instead, like the Cirth (runes), or even run words
together with no breaks at all (as in the One Ring inscription).</p>

<h2><a name="mellon">2. "Friend" in Sindarin</a></h2>
<div class="display" id="friend"></div>

<p>Here I at first thought we'd switched from Quenya to Sindarin, which is the
Elvish equivalent of switching from Latin to Italian.</p>

<p>But the Sindarin word for "friend" is just <i>mellon</i>.  It looks like this
in Tengwar:</p>

<img class="display" src="mellon.png"></p>

<p>That's an image because the webfont doesn't do a good job of combining the
<b>l</b> tengwa with the long tilde overlay that turns it into <b>ll</b>.</p>

<p>In case you were wondering, the Quenya word for "friend" is <i>melda</i>, <b class="tengwar">tFj2#</b>.

<p>I found online translations indicating that <i>mellonea</i> is "friends"
and <i>mellonamin</i> is "my friend". At first I took those to be Sindarin as well. However, they instead take the Sindarin base word and incorporate additions
from a fan-created Elven language that is only loosely-based on Tolkien's.
In and of itself, that's fine - unlike some of the reactions described at <a
href="http://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Grelvish">this article on so-called
"Grelvish"</a>, I'm not dismissing the work of the role-players who created it.
But personally, I just don't know how to transliterate it into Tengwar. The
Grey Company's own website includes a link to download a Tengwar font, but I
can't find any place where someone has created a Tengwar mode for their version
of Elven. Or even really described how to pronounce its words. Without knowing
how, for example, the apostrophe in <i>malia ten' vasa</i> is meant to be
pronounced, I can't really figure out how to map the sounds to the Tengwar
script.</p>

<p>So if you're going to use the Grey Company's phrasebook, your guess at
how to write the results in Elf-script is probably as good as mine - and
as the Grey Company Elves are quite sensibly more interested in having fun than
being sticklers for detail, they won't complain in any event. :)</p>

<p>But you're trying to do this for someone who is interested in authenticity,
and you just happened across the Grey Company's phrasebook while looking for
resources on "Elvish", that's another matter.  Unfortunately, there's not a
whole lot of genuine Elvish out there to find. One of the reasons the Grey
Company created Elven - apart from the whole "wanting to have fun instead of
spending our time trying to learn a whole other actual language" thing - was
because there aren't enough actual Quenya or Sindarin words to have much of a
conversation.  They had to extend the languages just to create the small bits
of dialogue found in the Lord of the Rings movies... unlike the Grey Company,
they hired professional linguists who attempted to go along Tolkien's original
lines, but it's still an after-the-fact extension.  As far as genuine
Tolkienian Elvish goes, it's possible we have no idea how to ask someone if
they would care for food or drink.</p>

<p>So with that background, let me know how you want to proceed.  We can
keep going with Grelvish and best guesses at the Tengwar; just want to 
make sure you understand what's going on.</p>
